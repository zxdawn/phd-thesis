  abstract = {Abstract The occurrence ratio of intracloud (IC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) discharges, which is denoted by Z-ratio, is the crucial parameter for the studies on the global electric circuit. However, the latitudinal and regional dependences of Z-ratio are not fully clarified. Therefore, using optical data obtained by the Global Lightning and Sprite Measurements on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-GLIMS), we distinguished the lightning discharge type, that is, IC, positive CG (+CG), and negative CG (?CG) discharges, and statistically estimated the Z-ratio. We analyzed 8,354 lightning events that obtained by JEM-GLIMS observation and succeeded in identifying 4,431 IC discharges, 597 +CG discharges, and 3,326 ?CG discharges. From this result, we calculated the Z-ratio over many regions around the world and estimated its latitudinal and regional dependences. It is found that the Z-ratio over the continental area is larger than the oceanic area. We also found that the Z-ratio significantly decreases with the latitude, which is generally comparable to the results shown in the previous studies. The estimated Z-ratio varies from 2.9?0.29 from the equator to 50\textdegree{} latitude, and the global mean value is 1.6. The regional dependence of Z-ratio derived from this study can be combined with the CG lightning data provided by the ground-based lightning detection networks to estimate the occurrence number of IC discharges. Then, the occurrence number of both IC and CG discharges can be used for calculating a more accurate estimation of the total lightning currents in the global electric circuit.},

  abstract = {Acid deposition and photochemical smog are urban air pollution problems, and they remain localized as long as the sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrocarbon pollutants are confined to the lower troposphere (below about 1-kilometer altitude) where they are short-lived. If, however, the contaminants are rapidly transported to the upper troposphere, then their atmospheric residence times grow and their range of influence expands dramatically. Although this vertical transport ameliorates some of the effects of acid rain by diluting atmospheric acids, it exacerbates global tropospheric ozone production by redistributing the necessary nitrogen catalysts. Results of recent computer simulations suggest that thunderstorms are one means of rapid vertical transport. To test this hypothesis, several research aircraft near a midwestern thunderstrom measured carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, ozone, and reactive nitrogen compounds. Their concentrations were much greater in the outflow region of the storm, up to 11 kilometers in altitude, than in surrounding air. Trace gas measurements can thus be used to track the motion of air in and around a cloud. Thunderstorms may transform local air pollution problems into regional or global atmospheric chemistry problems.},

  abstract = {In global models of tropospheric ozone and oxidized nitrogen, it is usually assumed that cloud-to-cloud discharges are 3 to 10 \texttimes{} less effective than cloud-to-ground discharges in producing nitrogen oxides (NOx). This assumption is based on a limited number of observations and experiments regarding the acoustic and optical energy spectrum of lightning discharges. We claim that cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground discharges dissipate similar amounts of energy and they may thereby be equally effective per discharge as NOx producers. Nevertheless, the mechanism of NOx production by electrical discharges still needs to be clarified, as well as whether there is a vertical differentiation in the production mechanism. We performed sensitivity studies with a global 3-D climatological tracer model (MOGUNTIA). The studies indicate that the simulated tropospheric distributions of oxidized nitrogen and ozone are sensitive to the vertical distribution of the lightning source assumed. Furthermore, it is shown that the strength of the global lightning source used in 3-D global model studies of oxidized nitrogen should be amplified by a factor of 2.6 if cloud-to-cloud discharges are equally effective as cloud-to-ground discharges in producing nitrogen oxides.},

  abstract = {Abstract Using a spectral-type cumulus parameterization that includes moist downdrafts within a three-dimensional mesoscale model, various disparate closure assumptions are systematically tested within the generalized framework of dynamic control, static control, and feedback. Only one assumption at a time is changed and tested using a midlatitude environment of severe convection. A control run is presented, which shows good agreement with observations in many aspects. Results of the sensitivity tests are compared to observations in terms of sea level pressure, rainfall patterns, and domain-averaged bias errors (compared to the control run) of various properties. The dynamic control is the part that determines the modulation of the convection by the environment. It is shown that rate of destabilization, as well as instantaneous stability, work well for the dynamic control. Integrated moisture convergence leads to underprediction of rainfall rates and subsequent degrading of the results in terms of movement and structure of the mesoscale convective system (MCS). The feedback determines the modification of the environment by the convection, and in this study is considered together with the static control, which determines cloud properties. All feedback and static-control assumptions tested here seem very important for the prediction of sea level pressure and rainfall. The most crucial ones were downdrafts and lateral mixing. As an interesting by-product, it is shown that a very simplistic and computationally highly efficient convective parameterization scheme leads to a very realistic simulation of the MCS, if the scheme uses a stability closure, assumes a large cloud size, parameterizes moist downdrafts, and does not assume unrealistically law lateral mixing.},

  abstract = {A new convective parameterization is introduced that can make use of a large variety of assumptions previously introduced in earlier formulations. The assumptions are chosen so that they will generate a large spread in the solution. We then show two methods in which ensemble and data assimilation techniques may be used to find the best value to feed back to the larger scale model. First, we can use simple statistical methods to find the most probable solution. Second, the ensemble probability density function can be considered as an appropriate ``prior'' (a'priori density) for Bayesian data assimilation. Using this ``prior'', and information about observation likelihood, measured meteorological or climatological data can be directly assimilated into model fields. Given proper observations, the application of this technique is not restricted to convective parameterizations, but may be applied to other parameterizations as well.},

  abstract = {Reactive gases and aerosols are produced by terrestrial ecosystems, processed within plant canopies, and can then be emitted into the above-canopy atmosphere. Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of isoprene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global coverage with \textasciitilde 1 km\textsuperscript{2} spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from models and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission factors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribution. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is \textasciitilde 600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emission estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate isoprene emission estimates using the concentration distributions simulated using chemistry and transport models, due to the substantial uncertainties in other model components, but at least some global models produce reasonable results when using isoprene emission distributions similar to MEGAN estimates. In addition, comparison with isoprene emissions estimated from satellite formaldehyde observations indicates reasonable agreement. The sensitivity of isoprene emissions to earth system changes (e.g., climate and land-use) demonstrates the potential for large future changes in emissions. Using temperature distributions simulated by global climate models for year 2100, MEGAN estimates that isoprene emissions increase by more than a factor of two. This is considerably greater than previous estimates and additional observations are needed to evaluate and improve the methods used to predict future isoprene emissions.},

The characteristics of the three categories of WSMMPs were examined for an idealized storm case and a heavy rainfall event over Korea. In an idealized thunderstorm simulation, the overall evolutionary features of the storm are not sensitive to the number of hydrometeors in the WSMMPs; however, the evolution of surface precipitation is significantly influenced by the complexity in microphysics. A simulation experiment for a heavy rainfall event indicated that the evolution of the simulated precipitation with the inclusion of graupel (WSM6) is similar to that from the simple (WSM3) and mixed-phase (WSM5) microphysics in a low-resolution grid; however, in a high-resolution grid, the amount of rainfall increases and the peak intensity becomes stronger as the number of hydrometeors increases.},

Lightning detection systems use a hybrid location method of direction finding (DF) and the time difference of arrival (TOA). The stations use four localization algorithms, including two-station mixing, three-station mixing, four-station mixing and two-station amplitude. Among them, the four-station method has the highest positioning accuracy, i.e., close to 50\&thinsp;\%. The statistical results show that lightning occurrences in China have increased, especially negative cloud-to-ground (\&minus;CG) flashes because positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) flashes account for only 5.1\&thinsp;\% of the total. In china, most of lightning currents range are in the \&minus;60\&thinsp;\textasciitilde\&thinsp;+60\&thinsp;kA, Lightning current between \&minus;10\&thinsp;\textasciitilde\&thinsp;+10\&thinsp;kA only accounted for small proportion of 0.6\&thinsp;\%.The average intensity of positive flashes is 64.2\&thinsp;kA, the average intensity of negative flashes is \&minus;40.28\&thinsp;kA. The average +CG intensity is higher than that of \&minus;CG flashes, which is consistent with statistical results of other Lightning detection network. Lightning frequency has obvious regional differences across the country; the high density lightning area is mainly distributed in south-central China, the south-central Yangtze River region and the eastern part of southwestern China. Seasonal variation in lightning activity is well defined, with few lightning occurrences in winter and a gradual but significant increase from spring to autumn in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to the north, south and southwest. The ratio of positive to negative flashes is highest in winter.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is considered to be a global atmospheric background location with limited anthropogenic influences. However, the observed summertime surface O3 concentration on the TP is 25\% higher than that in highly polluted regions (e.g., southern China). Previous studies have suggested that lightning-produced NOx (LNOx) can affect the concentration of surface O3. We used the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model combined with satellite, ground-based, and airborne observations to evaluate the contribution of LNOx to the surface O3 budget on the TP. Our results showed that LNOx contributed approximately 15\% of the surface NOx emission on the TP in summer. Accordingly, the contribution of LNOx to the summertime surface daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3 on the TP was 9.3 {$\pm$} 7.1 ppb, which was 17.5\% {$\pm$} 14.5\% of the total concentration of the surface MDA8 O3. In addition, our study found that the number of moles of NO produced per lightning flash (LNOx production efficiency) significantly affected the surface concentration of NOx, OH, and MDA8 O3. Increasing the LNOx production efficiency (PE) from 0 to 330 mol NO flash-1 increased the concentration of MDA8 O3 by up to 20\% on the TP. Our study revealed that lightning significantly affects the atmospheric chemical processes involving O3 on the TP.},

The model utilizes the ``bulk water'' microphysical parameterization technique to represent the precipitation fields which are all assumed to follow exponential size distribution functions. Autoconversion concepts are used to parameterize the collision-coalescence and collision-aggregation processes. Accretion processes involving the various forms of liquid and solid hydrometeors are simulated in this model. The transformation of cloud ice to snow through autoconversion (aggregation) and Bergeron process and subsequent accretional growth or aggregation to form hail are simulated. Hail is also produced by various contact mechanisms and via probabilistic freezing of raindrops. Evaporation (sublimation) is considered for all precipitation particles outside the cloud. The melting of hail and snow are included in the model. Wet and dry growth of hail and shedding of rain from hail are simulated. The simulations show that the inclusion of snow has improved the realism of the results compared to a model without snow. The formation of virga from cloud anvils is now modeled. Addition of the snow field has resulted in the inclusion of more diverse and physically sound mechanisms for initiating the hail field, yielding greater potential for distinguishing dominant embryo types characteristically different from warm- and cold-based clouds.},

In this time the instrument was tested and calibrated extensively. During this phase the geolocation calibration was validated using a dedicated measurement zoom mode. With the help of spacecraft manoeuvres the solar angle dependence of the irradiance radiometry was calibrated for both internal diffusers. This improved the results that were obtained on the ground significantly. Furthermore the orbital and long-term stability was tested for electronic gains, offsets, non-linearity, the dark current and the output of the internal light sources. The CCD output gain of the UV, UVIS and NIR detectors shows drifts over time which can be corrected in the Level 1b (L1b) processor. In-flight measurements also revealed inconsistencies in the radiometric calibration and degradation of the UV spectrometer. Degradation was also detected for the internal solar diffusers. Since the start of the nominal operations (E2) phase in orbit 2818 on 30 April 2018, regularly scheduled calibration measurements on the eclipse side of the orbit are used for monitoring and updates to calibration key data. This article reports on the main results of the commissioning phase, the in-flight calibration and the instrument's stability since launch. Insights from commissioning and in-flight monitoring have led to updates to the L1b processor and its calibration key data. The updated processor is planned to be used for nominal processing from late 2020 on.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

These instruments have an effective range between about 12 and 16 km depending upon site latitude and type of lightning and have separate registers for negative ground flashes, positive ground flashes, and cloud flashes. From the registrations we have obtained approximate values of the annual lightning total flash density, Nt, and the cloud flash-to-ground flash ratio, z, at each site. We have observed a well-marked variation of Nt with latitude from 61 km-2 yr-1 at 1\textdegree{} to 0.66 km-2 yr-1 at 60\textdegree{} latitude. Nt falls by a factor of about 10 for a 30\textdegree{} increase in latitude, in reasonable agreement with estimates based on satellite observations. Earlier studies concerning the latitudinal variation of z showed that z was high (about 6 to 9) in the tropics, was about 3 to 4 in the subtropics and temperate regions, and was about 1 to 1.5 at high latitudes. However, we have found tropical values of z in the range 0.5 to 3.4 (weighted mean 2.3 for latitude range 0\textdegree{} to 20\textdegree ) and similar values in subtropical and temperate regions (range from 1.1 to 3.8 and weighted mean 2.2 for the latitude range 20\textdegree{} to 40\textdegree ). At high latitudes (40\textdegree{} to 60\textdegree ) our measured values (range 1.0 to 1.5 and weighted mean 1.3) agree with the earlier studies. The weighting was by years of observation at the site. The mean of the values of z measured at 14 sites was 1.9. Values of z at 13 of the sites were within a factor of 2 of this mean. We estimate the global mean value of z to be 2.3, based on weighting site z values by site total flash density. We have compared lightning occurrence characteristics at eight sites between 60\textdegree N and 27\textdegree S.},

GLM detection efficiency (DE) relative to ENL varied spatially with greater DE in the southeastern United States and lower DE in the Northern Plains. Regions with greater DE were often regions where most intracloud flashes had normal positive polarity, while lower DE regions frequently had inverted negative intracloud. According to the tripolar noninductive charging model, inverted intracloud flashes are lower altitude than normal intracloud flashes. This lower altitude flash may result in greater cloud scattering of the optical lightning signal, which at cloud top is less than the GLM detection limits. DE was generally also greater for greater absolute peak current flashes, which serves as a proxy for optical energy. Additionally, GLM observed flashes to be generally greater in area and duration in the eastern relative to the western CONUS, which may result in the greater DE. GLM DE was also varied with the solar zenith angle as greatest DE occurred at night. ENL DE relative to GLM was varied spatially over CONUS with greater DE over eastern CONUS. ENL DE was greater for flashes of greater GLM flash radiant energy, area, and duration.},

The GEOS-CHEM TTOCs capture 44\% of the variance of monthly mean TOMS TTOCs from the convective cloud differential method (CCD) with no global bias. Major discrepancies are found over northern Africa and south Asia where the TOMS TTOCs do not capture the seasonal enhancements from biomass burning found in the model and in aircraft observations. A characteristic feature of these northern tropical enhancements, in contrast to southern tropical enhancements, is that they are driven by the lower troposphere where the sensitivity of TOMS is poor due to Rayleigh scattering. We develop an efficiency correction to the TOMS retrieval algorithm that accounts for the variability of ozone in the lower troposphere. This efficiency correction increases TTOCs over biomass burning regions by 3\textendash 5 Dobson units (DU) and decreases them by 2\textendash 5 DU over oceanic regions, improving the agreement between CCD TTOCs and in situ observations. Applying the correction to CCD TTOCs reduces by {$\sim$}5 DU the magnitude of the ``tropical Atlantic paradox'' [Thompson et al., 2000], i.e. the presence of a TTOC enhancement over the southern tropical Atlantic during the northern African biomass burning season in December\textendash February. We reproduce the remainder of the paradox in the model and explain it by the combination of upper tropospheric ozone production from lightning NOx, persistent subsidence over the southern tropical Atlantic as part of the Walker circulation, and cross-equatorial transport of upper tropospheric ozone from northern midlatitudes in the African ``westerly duct.'' These processes in the model can also account for the observed 13\textendash 17 DU persistent wave-1 pattern in TTOCs with a maximum over the tropical Atlantic and a minimum over the tropical Pacific during all seasons. The photochemical effects of mineral dust have only a minor role on the modeled distribution of TTOCs, including over northern Africa, due to multiple competing effects. The photochemical effects of mineral dust globally decrease annual mean OH concentrations by 9\%. A global lightning NOx source of 6 Tg N yr-1 in the model produces a simulation that is most consistent with TOMS and in situ observations.},

Using the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V research aircraft, the experiment investigated the photochemical environment over the tropical western Pacific (TWP) warm pool, a region of massive deep convection and the major pathway for air to enter the stratosphere during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter. The new observations provide a wealth of information for quantifying the influence of convection on the vertical distributions of active species. The airborne in situ measurements up to 15 km altitude fill a significant gap by characterizing the abundance and altitude variation of a wide suite of trace gases. These measurements, together with observations of dynamical and microphysical parameters, provide significant new data for constraining and evaluating global chemistry climate models. Measurements include precursor and product gas species of reactive halogen compounds that impact ozone in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. High accuracy, in-situ measurements of ozone obtained during CONTRAST quantify ozone concentration profiles in the UT, where previous observations from balloon-borne ozonesondes were often near or below the limit of detection. CONTRAST was one of the three coordinated experiments to observe the TWP during January-February 2014. Together, CONTRAST, ATTREX and CAST, using complementary capabilities of the three aircraft platforms as well as ground-based instrumentation, provide a comprehensive quantification of the regional distribution and vertical structure of natural and pollutant trace gases in the TWP during NH winter, from the oceanic boundary to the lower stratosphere.},

The 29 observations, covering a latitude range 69\textdegree N to 37\textdegree S, gave a mean value of z of 3.35. The empirical relationship proposed between z and {$\lambda$} is z{$\lambda\lambda\lambda$} From 26 pairs of values of z and T, covering the range 5 to 81 thunderdays per year, the proposed relationship is zTTT zT Information on z for high latitudes is sparse. It is probable that z lies between 1 and 2 for {$\lambda$} {$>$} 60\textdegree{} and T {$<$} 10. The existence of a relationship between z and T is attributed to the fact that both are related to latitude. The relationship between z and {$\lambda$} probably depends on the variation of freezing level height with latitude, and a possible relationship between z and freezing level height is examined. Where both {$\lambda$} and T are known, the proposed estimate of z for {$\lambda$} up to 60\textdegree{} and T up to 84 is z{$\lambda$}T{$\lambda$}T{$\lambda$}},

  abstract = {This paper begins a study on the role of lightning in maintaining the global distribution of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the troposphere. It presents the first global and seasonal distributions of lightning-produced NOx (LNOx) based on the observed distribution of electrical storms and the physical properties of lightning strokes. We derive a global rate for cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes of 20\textendash 30 flashes/s with a mean energy per flash of 6.7\texttimes 109 J. Intracloud (IC) flashes are more frequent, 50\textendash 70 flashes/s but have 10\% of the energy of CG strokes and, consequently, produce significantly less NOx. It appears to us that the majority of previous studies have mistakenly assumed that all lightning flashes produce the same amount of NOx, thus overestimating the NOx production by a factor of 3. On the other hand, we feel these same studies have underestimated the energy released in CG flashes, resulting in two negating assumptions. For CG energies we adopt a production rate of 10\texttimes 1016 molecules NO/J based on the current literature. Using a method to simulate global lightning frequencies from satellite-observed cloud data, we have calculated the LNOx on various spatial (regional, zonal, meridional, and global) and temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, and interannual). Regionally, the production of LNOx is concentrated over tropical continental regions, predominantly in the summer hemisphere. The annual mean production rate is calculated to be 12.2 Tg N/yr, and we believe it extremely unlikely that this number is less than 5 or more than 20 Tg N/yr. Although most of LNOx, is produced in the lowest 5 km by CG lightning, convective mixing in the thunderstorms is likely to deposit large amounts of NOx, in the upper troposphere where it is important in ozone production. On an annual basis, 64\% of the LNOx, is produced in the northern hemisphere, implying that the northern hemisphere should have natural ozone levels as much as 2 times greater than the southern hemisphere, even before anthropogenic influences. The amount of O3 produced from this NOx is expected to exceed the stratospheric source by a factor of 1.5, and thus the hemispheric asymmetry in LNOx would lead to a significant excess of northern hemisphere O3 even in the preindustrial troposphere. (The monthly climatologies for LNOx on a 1\textdegree\texttimes 1\textdegree{} latitude-longitude grid can be obtained by e-mail to cprice@flash.tau.ac.il).},

  abstract = {In this paper, we first study the dynamics of hot shocks in air in cylindrical geometry coupled to multiband radiation transport and detailed air chemistry. The wide energy and length scale ranges which are covered herein includes and exceeds the ones of first and subsequent return strokes happening during lightning discharges. An emphasis is put on the NOx production and the optical power emitted by strong shocks as the ones generated by Joule heating of the air from intense current flows. The production rate of NOx, which is useful for atmospheric global modeling, is found to be between 4.5 \texttimes{} 1016 and 8.6 \texttimes{} 1016 molecules/J for all computed cases, which is in agreement with the literature. Two different radiation transport methods are used to characterize the variability of the results according to the radiation transport method. With the exact radiation solver, we show that between 15 and 40\% of the energy is lost by radiation, with a percentage between 20 and 25\% for averaged lightning energies. The maximal visible peak is between 7 \texttimes{} 108 W/m and 3 \texttimes{} 107 W/m obtained for, respectively, a 19 kJ/cm and a 28 J/cm energy input. The mean radiated powers in the visible range are found between 9 \texttimes{} 106 W/m and 2 \texttimes{} 105 W/m for the energies just mentioned. We discuss the agreement of these values with previous studies.},

  abstract = {An experimental VLF WorldWide Lightning Location (WWLL) network is being developed to provide realtime locations of cloud to ground lightning discharges occurring throughout the globe. This network has expanded from a limited number of stations in the Western Pacific to its current state of 11 stations, in most longitude sectors, with additional stations planned in the near future. As part of the initial testing phase of the WWLL the network has operated in a simple mode, sending the station trigger times into a central processing point rather than using the sferic Time of Group Arrival (TOGA). During this initial stage, a significant quantity of lightning location data has been collected, some of which is being applied to research questions. In this paper the operation of the WWLL network is described, and the location accuracy of the pre-TOGA WWLL network is characterised. This is performed by contrasting commercial lightning location data from an Australian network, Kattron, over 2 days in January 2002, with 4 WWLL stations covering the same region. It was found that there were 426 matched lightning events, corresponding to lightning discharges with large lightning return stroke peak currents (mean absolute peak current of {$\sim$}26 kA compared with {$\sim$}12 kA for all Kattron events). By considering the random errors in the difference locations between the matching lightning events, an appropriate Gaussian timing error for the WWLL network of receiving stations is determined, and hence an estimate for the global location errors for the existing 11-station network is found. The ``worst-case'' global location error for the existing network ranges spatially from 7.5\textendash 100 km, with the global median being 15 km, and the global mean 30 km. When the TOGA method is implemented, the station timing errors will decrease, allowing for an increase in the location accuracies. Hence, the location accuracy estimates determined in this paper will be very conservative for the future WWLL network employing the TOGA technique.},

  abstract = {Lightning discharges generate broadband electromagnetic pulses with a peak component in the very low frequency (VLF; 3\textendash 30 kHz) range. VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range ({$\leq$}6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms in a set of waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1\textendash 4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between {$\sim$}40 and 60\% is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additional events reported by the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values reported by NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an Earth-referenced channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes.},

The data set, composed of 353 million flashes, was compared with the National Lightning Detection NetworkTM for peak current accuracy, location accuracy, and detection efficiency. The validation results demonstrated a mean (geometric mean) peak current magnitude error of 21\% (6\%), a median location accuracy of 2.5 km, and a relative ground flash detection efficiency of 57\% averaged over all positive and negative reference flashes, and 67\% for all reference flashes above 15 kA. The distribution of peak currents for negative flashes shifts to higher magnitudes over the ocean. Three case study 10\textdegree\texttimes 10\textdegree{} regions are analyzed, in which the peak current enhancement is extremely sharp at the coastline, suggesting that the higher peak currents for oceanic lightning cannot be solely attributable to network artifacts such as detection efficiency and peak current estimation error. In these regions, the geometric mean and 95th percentile of the peak current distribution for negative cloud to ocean flashes is 22\%\textendash 88\% and 65\%\textendash 121\% higher, respectively, compared to cloud to ground flashes in nearby land regions. Globally, the majority of all negative flashes with estimated peak current magnitude above 75 kA occur over the ocean.},

At an RO(2) lifetime of {$\sim$}30 s, {$\delta$}-nitrooxy and {$\beta$}-nitrooxy alkylperoxy radicals are present in similar amounts. Gas-phase product yields from the RO(2) + HO(2) pathway are identified as 0.75-0.78 isoprene nitrooxy hydroperoxide (INP), 0.22 methyl vinyl ketone (MVK) + formaldehyde (CH(2)O) + hydroxyl radical (OH) + nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), and 0-0.03 methacrolein (MACR) + CH(2)O + OH + NO(2). We further examined the photochemistry of INP and identified propanone nitrate (PROPNN) and isoprene nitrooxy hydroxyepoxide (INHE) as the main products. INHE undergoes similar heterogeneous chemistry as isoprene dihydroxy epoxide (IEPOX), likely contributing to atmospheric secondary organic aerosol formation.},

The experiments have shown that the performance characteristics of the two ECC-sonde types can be significantly different, even when operated under the same conditions. Particularly above 20 km the ENSCI-Z sonde tends to measure 5\textendash 10\% more ozone than the SPC-6A sonde. Below 20 km the differences are 5\% or less, but appear to show some differences with year of manufacture. There is a significant difference in the ozone readings when sondes of the same type are operated with different cathode sensing solutions. Testing the most commonly used sensing solutions showed that for each ECC-manufacturer type the use of 1.0\% KI and full buffer gives 5\% larger ozone values compared with the use of 0.5\% KI and half buffer, and as much as 10\% larger values compared with 2.0\% KI and no buffer. For ozone sounding stations performing long term measurements this means that changing the sensing solution type or ECC-sonde type can easily introduce a change of {$\pm$}5\% or more in their records, affecting determination of ozone trends. Standardization of operating procedures for ECC-sondes yields a precision better than {$\pm$}(3\textendash 5)\% and an accuracy of about {$\pm$}(5\textendash 10)\% up to 30 km altitude.},

More limited data suggest that stratospheric water vapor probably increased between 1980 and 2000, which would have enhanced the decadal rate of surface warming during the 1990s by about 30\% as compared to estimates neglecting this change. These findings show that stratospheric water vapor is an important driver of decadal global surface climate change.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) is one of the main data products measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, which combines a high signal-to-noise ratio with daily global coverage and high spatial resolution. TROPOMI provides a valuable source of information to monitor emissions from local sources such as power plants, industry, cities, traffic and ships, and variability of these sources in time. Validation exercises of NO\textsubscript{2} v1.2\textendash v1.3 data, however, have revealed that TROPOMI's tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) are too low by up to 50 \% over highly polluted areas. These findings are mainly attributed to biases in the cloud pressure retrieval, the surface albedo climatology and the low resolution of the a priori profiles derived from global simulations of the TM5-MP chemistry model.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This study describes improvements in the TROPOMI NO\textsubscript{2} retrieval leading to version v2.2, operational since 1 July 2021. Compared to v1.x, the main changes are the following. (1) The NO\textsubscript{2}-v2.2 data are based on version-2 level-1b (ir)radiance spectra with improved calibration, which results in a small and fairly homogeneous increase in the NO\textsubscript{2} slant columns of 3 \% to 4 \%, most of which ends up as a small increase in the stratospheric columns. (2) The cloud pressures are derived with a new version of the FRESCO cloud retrieval already introduced in NO\textsubscript{2}-v1.4, which led to a lowering of the cloud pressure, resulting in larger tropospheric NO\textsubscript{2} columns over polluted scenes with a small but non-zero cloud coverage. (3) For cloud-free scenes a surface albedo correction is introduced based on the observed reflectance, which also leads to a general increase in the tropospheric NO\textsubscript{2} columns over polluted scenes of order 15 \%. (4) An outlier removal was implemented in the spectral fit, which increases the number of good-quality retrievals over the South Atlantic Anomaly region and over bright clouds where saturation may occur. (5) Snow/ice information is now obtained from ECMWF weather data, increasing the number of valid retrievals at high latitudes.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}On average the NO\textsubscript{2}-v2.2 data have tropospheric VCDs that are between 10 \% and 40 \% larger than the v1.x data, depending on the level of pollution and season; the largest impact is found at mid and high latitudes in wintertime. This has brought these tropospheric NO\textsubscript{2} closer to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) observations. Ground-based validation shows on average an improvement of the negative bias of the stratospheric (from -6 \% to -3 \%), tropospheric (from -32 \% to -23 \%) and total (from -12 \% to -5 \%) columns. For individual measurement stations, however, the picture is more complex, in particular for the tropospheric and total columns.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The results showed the presence of 299 lightning days with 241 688 flashes, most of which were IC lightning flashes. Only 19\% of the total flashes were CG lightning flashes; 14\% of these CG flashes were positive. Most lightning activity occurred during the summer months (June\textendash August), with a major diurnal peak around 1900 Beijing standard time (BST) and a secondary peak around 2300 BST. Spatial variations in flash density and lightning days both exhibited an obvious southeastwardly increasing pattern, with higher flash densities or more lightning days occurring in the southeastern plains and lower values distributed on the northwestern mountains. The {$<$}em{$>$}Z{$<$}/em{$>$} ratio (IC/CG lightning flashes) exhibited a similar spatial pattern, but the percentage of positive CG lightning flashes showed an almost opposite pattern. The results also showed significant topographic effects on the spatiotemporal variations in lightning activity. That is, flash counts on the northeastern and southwestern mountains peaked in the afternoon, whereas those on the southeastern plains peaked in the late night to early morning, which could be attributed to the propagation of thunderstorms from the mountains to the plains. The results showed that the SAFIR-3000 lightning data are more useful than CG lightning data alone for forecasting the development and propagation of thunderstorms over the BMR.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

There are clear interannual and seasonal variations of CG lightning activity. The mean total CG and positive CG (PCG) flashes in 2010\textendash 13 are approximately 6.44 million and 0.42 million, respectively, and the mean percentage of PCG (PPCG) is 6.6\%. CG and PCG flashes predominately occur during summer, with August being the peak month for CG and June for PCG. PPCG in the cold season is considerably greater than in the warm season; its maximum of 56.2\% is in January and the minimum value of 4.0\% is found in August. The centers of maximum mean annual CG density are scattered throughout southern China, the Sichuan basin, and the south of Jiangsu Province. The CG density in the high elevations and arid regions of western China is less than that in the low elevations and coastal regions of southeastern China. In addition, daily CG density and CG lightning days in southeastern China are greater than in northwestern China, but PPCG in western China is apparently greater than that in eastern China. Areas experiencing more than 30 CG lightning days per year are primarily south of 30\textdegree N, with 10\textendash 30 lightning days per year in northern and northeastern China, and approximately 10\textendash 20 lightning days per year over the central Tibetan Plateau.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

However, the production efficiency (PE) of lightning nitrogen oxides (LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}}) is still quite uncertain (32\textendash 1100\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO per flash). Satellite measurements are a powerful tool to estimate LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} directly compared to conventional platforms. To apply satellite data in both clean and polluted regions, a new algorithm for calculating LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} has been developed that uses the Berkeley High-Resolution (BEHR) v3.0B NO\textsubscript{2} retrieval algorithm and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem). LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} PE over the continental US is estimated using the NO\textsubscript{2} product of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data and the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) data. Focusing on the summer season during 2014, we find that the lightning NO\textsubscript{2} (LNO\textsubscript{2}) PE is 32{$\pm$}15\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{2} per flash and 6{$\pm$}3\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{2} per stroke while LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} PE is 90{$\pm$}50\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} per flash and 17{$\pm$}10\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} per stroke. Results reveal that our method reduces the sensitivity to the background NO\textsubscript{2} and includes much of the below-cloud LNO\textsubscript{2}. As the LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} parameterization varies in studies, the sensitivity of our calculations to the setting of the amount of lightning NO (LNO) is evaluated. Careful consideration of the ratio of LNO\textsubscript{2} to NO\textsubscript{2} is also needed, given its large influence on the estimation of LNO\textsubscript{2} PE.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} The joint effects of aerosol, thermodynamic, and cloud-related factors on cloud-to-ground lightning in Sichuan were investigated by a comprehensive analysis of ground-based measurements made from 2005 to 2017 in combination with reanalysis data. Data include aerosol optical depth, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning density, convective available potential energy (CAPE), mid-level relative humidity, lower- to mid-tropospheric vertical wind shear, cloud-base height, total column liquid water (TCLW), and total column ice water (TCIW). Results show that CG lightning density and aerosols are positively correlated in the plateau region and negatively correlated in the basin region. Sulfate aerosols are found to be more strongly associated with lightning than total aerosols, so this study focuses on the role of sulfate aerosols in lightning activity. In the plateau region, the lower aerosol concentration stimulates lightning activity through microphysical effects. Increasing the aerosol loading decreases the cloud droplet size, reducing the cloud droplet collision\textendash coalescence efficiency and inhibiting the warm-rain process. More small cloud droplets are transported above the freezing level to participate in the freezing process, forming more ice particles and releasing more latent heat during the freezing process. Thus, an increase in the aerosol loading increases CAPE, TCLW, and TCIW, stimulating CG lightning in the plateau region. In the basin region, by contrast, the higher concentration of aerosols inhibits lightning activity through the radiative effect. An increase in the aerosol loading reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground, thereby lowering the CAPE. The intensity of convection decreases, resulting in less supercooled water being transported to the freezing level and fewer ice particles forming, thereby increasing the total liquid water content. Thus, an increase in the aerosol loading suppresses the intensity of convective activity and CG lightning in the basin region.{$<$}/p{$>$}},
