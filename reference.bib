  abstract = {Nitrogen oxides produced by lightning (LNOx) play an important role in determining mid- and upper-tropospheric concentrations of the hydroxyl radical (OH), methane (CH4), and ozone (O3). The moles of NOx produced per flash was examined using nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns and cloud properties from the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and flash counts from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) aboard the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16) and Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) for 29 convective systems over the United States that occurred during 2018 and 2019. For each of the case studies, the LNOx production efficiency (PE) was estimated using TROPOMI pixels over deep convection. First, the NOx columns associated with the TROPOMI NO2 columns were estimated using a specially-derived air mass factor (AMF). The tropospheric column due to recent lightning was then determined by subtracting from the median NOx column a background representative of the NOx column due to sources other than recent lightning. Then, the PE was calculated by multiplying the LNOx column by the storm area and dividing by the number of flashes contributing to the column. For a three-hour chemical lifetime, the mean PE was found to be 175 {$\pm$} 100 mol per flash for optical flashes from GLM and 120 {$\pm$} 65 mol per flash for radio-wave-detected flashes from ENTLN. The uncertainty associated with these values is mostly due to uncertainties in tropospheric background, AMF, and detection efficiency. GLM PE for individual systems was found to be positively correlated with optical energy.},

Here, using data collected during aircraft sampling of the TWP in winter 2014, we find strong, positive correlations of O3 with multiple biomass burning tracers in these HOLW structures. Ozone levels in these structures are about a factor of three larger than background. Models, satellite data and aircraft observations are used to show fires in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia are the dominant source of high O3 and that low H2O results from large-scale descent within the tropical troposphere. Previous explanations that attribute HOLW structures to transport from the stratosphere or mid-latitude troposphere are inconsistent with our observations. This study suggest a larger role for biomass burning in the radiative forcing of climate in the remote TWP than is commonly appreciated.},

  abstract = {Abstract The occurrence ratio of intracloud (IC) to cloud-to-ground (CG) discharges, which is denoted by Z-ratio, is the crucial parameter for the studies on the global electric circuit. However, the latitudinal and regional dependences of Z-ratio are not fully clarified. Therefore, using optical data obtained by the Global Lightning and Sprite Measurements on Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-GLIMS), we distinguished the lightning discharge type, that is, IC, positive CG (+CG), and negative CG (?CG) discharges, and statistically estimated the Z-ratio. We analyzed 8,354 lightning events that obtained by JEM-GLIMS observation and succeeded in identifying 4,431 IC discharges, 597 +CG discharges, and 3,326 ?CG discharges. From this result, we calculated the Z-ratio over many regions around the world and estimated its latitudinal and regional dependences. It is found that the Z-ratio over the continental area is larger than the oceanic area. We also found that the Z-ratio significantly decreases with the latitude, which is generally comparable to the results shown in the previous studies. The estimated Z-ratio varies from 2.9?0.29 from the equator to 50\textdegree{} latitude, and the global mean value is 1.6. The regional dependence of Z-ratio derived from this study can be combined with the CG lightning data provided by the ground-based lightning detection networks to estimate the occurrence number of IC discharges. Then, the occurrence number of both IC and CG discharges can be used for calculating a more accurate estimation of the total lightning currents in the global electric circuit.},

Over land, regions with high (eastern US) and low (India) flash strength can be clearly identified. We discuss possible causes for and implications of the observed regional differences. Although a direct quantitative interpretation of the investigated flash properties is difficult, the observed spatial patterns provide valuable information for the interpretation and application of climatological flash rates. Due to the systematic regional variations of physical flash characteristics, viewing conditions, and/or measurement sensitivities, parametrizations of lightning NO\textsubscript{x} based on total flash rate densities alone are probably affected by regional biases.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A comparison between OMI and the TM4 model tropospheric NO\textsubscript{2} profiles reveals striking overall similarities, which confer great confidence to the cloud-slicing approach to provide details that pertain to annual as well as seasonal means, along with localized discrepancies that seem to probe into particular model processes. Anomalies detected at the lowest levels can be traced to deficiencies in the model surface emission inventory, at mid-tropospheric levels to convective transport and horizontal advective diffusion, and at the upper tropospheric levels to model lightning NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} production and the placement of deeply transported NO\textsubscript{2} plumes such as from the Asian summer monsoon. The vertical information contained in the OMI cloud-sliced NO\textsubscript{2} profiles provides a global observational constraint that can be used to evaluate chemistry transport models (CTMs) and guide the development of key parameterization schemes.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Climate change has the potential to increase surface ozone (O3) concentrations, known as the ``ozone\textendash climate penalty'', through changes to atmospheric chemistry, transport and dry deposition. In the tropics, the response of surface O3 to changing climate is relatively understudied but has important consequences for air pollution and human and ecosystem health. In this study, we evaluate the change in surface O3 due to climate change over South America and Africa using three state-of-the-art Earth system models that follow the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0 emission scenario from CMIP6. In order to quantify changes due to climate change alone, we evaluate the difference between simulations including climate change and simulations with a fixed present-day climate. We find that by 2100, models predict an ozone\textendash climate penalty in areas where O3 is already predicted to be high due to the impacts of precursor emissions, namely urban and biomass burning areas, although on average, models predict a decrease in surface O3 due to climate change. We identify a small but robust positive trend in annual mean surface O3 over polluted areas. Additionally, during biomass burning seasons, seasonal mean O3 concentrations increase by 15 ppb (model range 12 to 18 ppb) in areas with substantial biomass burning such as the arc of deforestation in the Amazon. The ozone\textendash climate penalty in polluted areas is shown to be driven by an increased rate of O3 chemical production, which is strongly influenced by NOx concentrations and is therefore specific to the emission pathway chosen. Multiple linear regression finds the change in NOx concentration to be a strong predictor of the change in O3 production, whereas increased isoprene emission rate is positively correlated with increased O3 destruction, suggesting NOx-limited conditions over the majority of tropical Africa and South America. However, models disagree on the role of climate change in remote, low-NOx regions, partly because of significant differences in NOx concentrations produced by each model. We also find that the magnitude and location of the ozone\textendash climate penalty in the Congo Basin has greater inter-model variation than that in the Amazon, so further model development and validation are needed to constrain the response in central Africa. We conclude that if the climate were to change according to the emission scenario used here, models predict that forested areas in biomass burning locations and urban populations will be at increasing risk of high O3 exposure, irrespective of any direct impacts on O3 via the prescribed emission scenario.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Previous analyses of very high frequency (VHF) Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) observations relative to the location of deep convective updrafts have noted a systematic pattern in flash characteristics. In and near strong updrafts, flashes tend to be smaller and more frequent, while flashes far from strong vertical drafts exhibit the opposite tendency. This study quantitatively tests these past anecdotal observations using LMA data for two supercell storms that occurred in Oklahoma in 2004. The data support a prediction from electrostatics that frequent breakdown and large flash extents are opposed. An energetic scaling that combines flash rate and flash area exhibits a power-law scaling regime on scales of a few kilometers and a maximum in flash energy at about 10 km. The spectral shape is surprisingly consistent across a range of moderate to large flash rates. The shape of this lightning flash energy spectrum is similar to that expected of turbulent kinetic energy spectra in thunderstorms. In line with the hypothesized role of convective motions as the generator of thunderstorm electrical energy, the correspondence between kinematic and electrical energy spectra suggests that advection of charge-bearing precipitation by the storm's flow, including in turbulent eddies, couples the electrical and kinematic properties of a thunderstorm.},

To evaluate the WWLLN detection efficiency, the strokes detected by WWLLN in the field of view of LIS were determined and matched with the flashes detected by LIS. The spatial and time distribution of the strokes detected by WWLLN show a good correlation with the flashes detected by LIS despite the low detection efficiency reported for WWLLLN. The analysis shows that WWLLN is capable of detecting more than one stroke per flash with a global multiplicity of 1.5. However, not all strokes detected by WWLLN in the field of view of LIS could be assigned to a flash. These unmatched strokes show a spatial and time distribution, as well as an energy distribution, similar to those of the matched strokes. The unmatched strokes seem to correspond to cloud-to-ground flashes which are not well detected by LIS. Based on matched flashes and multiplicity, a correction of the WWLLN data was derived. With this correction, a global lightning flash rate of 60 fl s-1 was obtained and a map of the corrected flash density detected by WWLLN was performed. The spatial distribution of WWLLN multiplicity and detection probability are available for the community.},

  abstract = {Gridded climatologies of total lightning flash rates observed by the spaceborne Optical Transient Detector (OTD) and Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) instruments have been updated. OTD collected data from May 1995 to March 2000. LIS data (equatorward of about 38\textdegree ) adds the years 1998\textendash 2010. Flash counts from each instrument are scaled by the best available estimates of detection efficiency. The long LIS record makes the merged climatology most robust in the tropics and subtropics, while the high latitude data is entirely from OTD. The gridded climatologies include annual mean flash rate on a 0.5\textdegree{} grid, mean diurnal cycle of flash rate on a 2.5\textdegree{} grid with 24hour resolution, mean annual cycle of flash rate on a 0.5\textdegree{} or 2.5\textdegree{} grid with daily, monthly, or seasonal resolution, mean annual cycle of the diurnal cycle on a 2.5\textdegree{} grid with two hour resolution for each day, and time series of flash rate over the sixteen year record with roughly three-month smoothing. For some of these (e.g., annual cycle of the diurnal cycle), more smoothing is necessary for results to be robust. The mean global flash rate from the merged climatology is 46flashess-1. This varies from around 35flashess-1 in February (austral summer) to 60flashess-1 in August (boreal summer). The peak annual flash rate at 0.5\textdegree{} scale is 160flkm-2yr-1 in eastern Congo. The peak monthly average flash rate at 2.5\textdegree{} scale is 18flkm-2mo-1 from early April to early May in the Brahmaputra Valley of far eastern India. Lightning decreases in this region during the monsoon season, but increases further north and west. An August peak in northern Pakistan also exceeds any monthly averages from Africa, despite central Africa having the greatest yearly average.},

  abstract = {The Optical Transient Detector (OTD) is a space-based instrument specifically designed to detect and locate lightning discharges as it orbits the Earth. This instrument is a scientific payload on the MicroLab-1 satellite that was launched into a 70\textdegree{} inclination low Earth orbit in April 1995. Given the orbital trajectory of the satellite, most regions of the Earth are observed by the OTD instrument more than 400 times during a 1 year period, and the average duration of each observation is 2 min. The OTD instrument optically detects lightning flashes that occur within its 1300 \texttimes{} 1300 km2 field of view during both day and night conditions. A statistical examination of OTD lightning data reveals that nearly 1.4 billion flashes occur annually over the entire Earth. This annual flash count translates to an average of 44 {$\pm$} 5 lightning flashes (intracloud and cloud-to-ground combined) occurring around the globe every second, which is well below the traditional estimate of 100 fl s-1 that was derived in 1925 from world thunder day records. The range of uncertainty for the OTD global totals represents primarily the uncertainty (and variability) in the flash detection efficiency of the instrument. The OTD measurements have been used to construct lightning climatology maps that demonstrate the geographical and seasonal distribution of lightning activity for the globe. An analysis of this annual lightning distribution confirms that lightning occurs mainly over land areas, with an average land/ocean ratio of {$\sim$}10:1. The Congo basin, which stands out year-round, shows a peak mean annual flash density of 80 fl km-2 yr-1 in Rwanda, and includes an area of over 3 million km2 exhibiting flash densities greater than 30 fl km-2 yr-1 (the flash density of central Florida). Lightning is predominant in the northern Atlantic and western Pacific Ocean basins year-round where instability is produced from cold air passing over warm ocean water. Lightning is less frequent in the eastern tropical Pacific and Indian Ocean basins where the air mass is warmer. A dominant Northern Hemisphere summer peak occurs in the annual cycle, and evidence is found for a tropically driven semiannual cycle.},

Using a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem), we find that these events result from deep convective processes that rapidly transport air with low ozone concentrations from the marine boundary layer. These events occur with greater frequency over the tropical South Pacific warm pool, which is consistent with ozonesonde observations. The satellite observations indicate spatial shifts in the frequency of low ozone events that we attribute to changes in convection. As the location of the warm pool shifts eastward during El Ni\~no events, the location of the most frequent low ozone events in the satellite record follows. Mapping of low ozone events over time reveals eastward propagating systems resembling the Madden-Julian Oscillation. These observations and analyses strengthen the link between deep convection and ozone concentrations in the tropical upper troposphere.},

Ground-based Doppler and dual polarimetric radar observations were used to compute updraft characteristics. Also, ground-based total lightning data were available at both locations. Results show that time series of updraft volume in the charging zone (at temperatures colder than -5\textdegree C) with vertical velocities greater than either 5 or 10 m s-1 have clear relationships with total lightning activity (r = 0.93). Furthermore, these relationships between updraft volume and lightning activity for the storm types of the two climate regimes tend to converge when considering only the subfreezing layers of the clouds. Neither the maximum nor the mean updraft speed correlate as well with total lightning activity (r = {$<$}0.8) as updraft volume. Through expanded study designed to explore further regime variability (or lack thereof) of updraft volume-lightning flash rate relationships, better or refined parameterizations for the numerical forecasting of lightning and/or detection and prediction of storm intensity could be realized.},

  abstract = {It is generally believed that a strong updraft in the mixed-phase region of thunderstorms is required to produce lightning. This is the region where the noninductive charging process is thought to generate most of the storm electrification. Analytic calculations and model results predict that the total lightning frequency is roughly proportional to the product of the downward mass flux of solid precipitation (graupel) and the upward mass flux of ice crystals. Thus far this flux hypothesis has only been tested in a very limited way. Herein we use dual-polarimetric and dual-Doppler radar observations in conjunction with total lightning data collected in Northern Alabama and also Colorado/Kansas during two field campaigns. These data are utilized to investigate total lightning activity as a function of precipitation and nonprecipitation ice masses and estimates of their fluxes for different storm types in different climate regions. A total of 11 storms, including single cell, multicell, and supercell storms, was analyzed in the two climatologically different regions. Time series of both precipitation and nonprecipitation ice mass estimates above the melting level show a good relationship with total lightning activity for the 11 storms analyzed (correlation coefficients exceed 0.9 and 0.8, respectively). Furthermore, the relationships are relatively invariant between the two climate regions. The correlations between total lightning and the associated product of ice mass fluxes are even higher. These observations provide strong support for the flux hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Acid deposition and photochemical smog are urban air pollution problems, and they remain localized as long as the sulfur, nitrogen, and hydrocarbon pollutants are confined to the lower troposphere (below about 1-kilometer altitude) where they are short-lived. If, however, the contaminants are rapidly transported to the upper troposphere, then their atmospheric residence times grow and their range of influence expands dramatically. Although this vertical transport ameliorates some of the effects of acid rain by diluting atmospheric acids, it exacerbates global tropospheric ozone production by redistributing the necessary nitrogen catalysts. Results of recent computer simulations suggest that thunderstorms are one means of rapid vertical transport. To test this hypothesis, several research aircraft near a midwestern thunderstrom measured carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, ozone, and reactive nitrogen compounds. Their concentrations were much greater in the outflow region of the storm, up to 11 kilometers in altitude, than in surrounding air. Trace gas measurements can thus be used to track the motion of air in and around a cloud. Thunderstorms may transform local air pollution problems into regional or global atmospheric chemistry problems.},

We show that biomass burning pollution regularly and significantly impacts the composition of the TTL, LS, and LMS. Carbon monoxide (CO) in the LS in our simulation and data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) shows an annual oscillation in its composition that results from the interaction of an annual oscillation in slow ascent from the TTL to the LS and seasonal variations in sources, including a semi-annual oscillation in CO from biomass burning. The impacts of CO sources that peak when ascent is seasonally low are damped (e.g. Southern Hemisphere biomass burning) and vice-versa for sources that peak when ascent is seasonally high (e.g. extra-tropical fossil fuels). Interannual variation of CO in the UT/LS is caused primarily by year-to-year variations in biomass burning and the locations of deep convection. During our study period, 1994\&ndash;1998, we find that the highest concentrations of CO in the UT/LS occurred during the strong 1997\&ndash;1998 El Ni\&ntilde;o event for two reasons: i. tropical deep convection shifted to the eastern Pacific Ocean, closer to South American and African CO sources, and ii. emissions from Indonesian biomass burning were higher. This extreme event can be seen as an upper bound on the impact of biomass burning pollution on the UT/LS. We estimate that the 1997 Indonesian wildfires increased CO in the entire TTL and tropical LS (\&gt;60 mb) by more than 40\% and 10\%, respectively, for several months. Zonal mean ozone increased and the hydroxyl radical decreased by as much as 20\%, increasing the lifetimes and, subsequently TST, of trace gases. Our results indicate that the impact of biomass burning pollution on the UT/LS is likely greatest during an El Ni\&ntilde;o event due to favorable dynamics and historically higher burning rates.},

We use the Advanced Research Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model with a horizontal resolution of 333 m to examine this downward transport. The simulation reproduces the deep convective system, its timing and overshooting altitudes reasonably well compared to radar and aircraft observations. Passive tracers initialised at pre-storm times indicate the downward transport of air from the stratosphere to the upper troposphere as well as upward transport from the boundary layer into the cloud anvils and overshooting tops. For example, a passive ozone tracer (i.e. a tracer not undergoing chemical processing) shows an enhancement in the upper troposphere of up to about 30 ppbv locally in the cloud, while the in situ measurements show an increase of 50 ppbv. However, the passive carbon monoxide tracer exhibits an increase, while the observations show a decrease of about 10 ppbv, indicative of an erroneous model representation of the transport processes in the tropical tropopause layer. Furthermore, it could point to insufficient entrainment and detrainment in the model. The simulation shows a general moistening of air in the lower stratosphere, but it also exhibits local dehydration features. Here we use the model to explain the processes causing the transport and also expose areas of inconsistencies between the model and observations.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

As found in previous studies, the radar storm height is tightly correlated with the lightning flash rate. A roughly second order power-law fit to the mean radar echo top height above the 0\textdegree C isotherm is shown to capture both regional and land-ocean contrasts in lightning occurrence and flash rate using a single set of parameters. Recent developments should soon make it possible to implement a parameterization of this kind in global models. Parameterizations based on cloud top height, convective rain rate and convective rain fraction all require the use of separate fits over land and ocean and fail to capture observed differences between continental regions.},

This assumption is based on a limited number of observations and experiments regarding the acoustic and optical energy spectrum of lightning discharges. We claim that cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground discharges dissipate similar amounts of energy and they may thereby be equally effective per discharge as NOx producers. Nevertheless, the mechanism of NOx production by electrical discharges still needs to be clarified, as well as whether there is a vertical differentiation in the production mechanism. We performed sensitivity studies with a global 3-D climatological tracer model (MOGUNTIA). The studies indicate that the simulated tropospheric distributions of oxidized nitrogen and ozone are sensitive to the vertical distribution of the lightning source assumed. Furthermore, it is shown that the strength of the global lightning source used in 3-D global model studies of oxidized nitrogen should be amplified by a factor of 2.6 if cloud-to-cloud discharges are equally effective as cloud-to-ground discharges in producing nitrogen oxides.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), is the latest atmospheric reanalysis of the modern satellite era produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office (GMAO). MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

We produced the full data set by combining 500 m MODIS burned area maps with active fire data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS) and the Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) family of sensors. We found that the global annual area burned for the years 1997 through 2011 varied from 301 to 377Mha, with an average of 348Mha. We assessed the interannual variability and trends in burned area on the basis of a region-specific definition of fire years. With respect to trends, we found a gradual decrease of 1.7Mhayr - 1 ( - 1.4\%yr - 1) in Northern Hemisphere Africa since 2000, a gradual increase of 2.3Mhayr - 1 (+1.8\%yr - 1) in Southern Hemisphere Africa also since 2000, a slight increase of 0.2Mhayr - 1 (+2.5\%yr - 1) in Southeast Asia since 1997, and a rapid decrease of approximately 5.5Mhayr - 1 ( - 10.7\%yr - 1) from 2001 through 2011 in Australia, followed by a major upsurge in 2011 that exceeded the annual area burned in at least the previous 14 years. The net trend in global burned area from 2000 to 2012 was a modest decrease of 4.3Mhayr - 1 ( - 1.2\%yr - 1).

  abstract = {Observing the spatial heterogeneities of NO2 air pollution is an important first step in quantifying NOX emissions and exposures. This study investigates the capabilities of the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) in observing the spatial and temporal patterns of NO2 pollution in the continental United States. The unprecedented sensitivity of the sensor can differentiate the fine-scale spatial heterogeneities in urban areas, such as emissions related to airport/shipping operations and high traffic, and the relatively small emission sources in rural areas, such as power plants and mining operations. We then examine NO2 columns by day-of-the-week and find that Saturday and Sunday concentrations are 16\% and 24\% lower respectively, than during weekdays. We also analyze the correlation of daily maximum 2-m temperatures and NO2 column amounts and find that NO2 is larger on the hottest days ({$>$}32\textdegree C) as compared to warm days (26\textdegree C\textendash 32\textdegree C), which is in contrast to a general decrease in NO2 with increasing temperature at moderate temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that a linear regression fit of 2019 annual TROPOMI NO2 data to annual surface-level concentrations yields relatively strong correlation (R2 = 0.66). These new developments make TROPOMI NO2 satellite data advantageous for policymakers and public health officials, who request information at high spatial resolution and short timescales, in order to assess, devise, and evaluate regulations.},

Advanced spacecraft and instrument technology will support expanded detection of environmental phenomena, resulting in more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings. Advancements over current GOES capabilities include a new capability for total lightning detection (cloud and cloud-to-ground flashes) from the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), and improved cloud and moisture imagery with the 16-channel Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI). The GLM will map total lightning activity continuously day and night with near-uniform storm-scale spatial resolution of 8km with a product refresh rate of less than 20s over the Americas and adjacent oceanic regions in the western hemisphere. This will aid in forecasting severe storms and tornado activity, and convective weather impacts on aviation safety and efficiency. In parallel with the instrument development, an Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Lightning Detection Science and Applications Team developed the Level 2 (stroke and flash) algorithms from the Level 1 lightning event (pixel level) data. Proxy data sets used to develop the GLM operational algorithms as well as cal/val performance monitoring tools were derived from the NASA Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) and Optical Transient Detector (OTD) instruments in low Earth orbit, and from ground-based lightning networks and intensive prelaunch field campaigns. The GLM will produce the same or similar lightning flash attributes provided by the LIS and OTD, and thus extend their combined climatology over the western hemisphere into the coming decades. Science and application development along with preoperational product demonstrations and evaluations at NWS forecast offices and NOAA testbeds will prepare the forecasters to use GLM as soon as possible after the planned launch and checkout of GOES-R in late 2015. New applications will use GLM alone, in combination with the ABI, or integrated (fused) with other available tools (weather radar and ground strike networks, nowcasting systems, mesoscale analysis, and numerical weather prediction models) in the hands of the forecaster responsible for issuing more timely and accurate forecasts and warnings.},

The species considered in this study are carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and black carbon. The inventories considered include the ACCMIP historical emissions developed in support of the simulations for the IPCC AR5 assessment. Emissions for 2005 and 2010 from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) are also included. Large discrepancies between the global and regional emissions are identified, which shows that there is still no consensus on the best estimates for surface emissions of atmospheric compounds. At the global scale, anthropogenic emissions of CO, NOx and SO2 show the best agreement for most years, although agreement does not necessarily mean that uncertainty is low. The agreement is low for BC emissions, particularly in the period prior to 2000. The best consensus is for NOx emissions for all periods and all regions, except for China, where emissions in 1980 and 1990 need to be better defined. Emissions of CO need better quantification in the USA and India for all periods; in Central Europe, the evolution of emissions during the past two decades needs to be better determined. The agreement between the different SO2 emissions datasets is rather good for the USA, but better quantification is needed elsewhere, particularly for Central Europe, India and China. The comparisons performed in this study show that the use of RCP8.5 for the extension of the ACCMIP inventory beyond 2000 is reasonable, until more global or regional estimates become available. Concerning biomass burning emissions, most inventories agree within 50\textendash 80\%, depending on the year and season. The large differences between biomass burning inventories are due to differences in the estimates of burned areas from the different available products, as well as in the amount of biomass burned.},

  abstract = {Abstract Using a spectral-type cumulus parameterization that includes moist downdrafts within a three-dimensional mesoscale model, various disparate closure assumptions are systematically tested within the generalized framework of dynamic control, static control, and feedback. Only one assumption at a time is changed and tested using a midlatitude environment of severe convection. A control run is presented, which shows good agreement with observations in many aspects. Results of the sensitivity tests are compared to observations in terms of sea level pressure, rainfall patterns, and domain-averaged bias errors (compared to the control run) of various properties. The dynamic control is the part that determines the modulation of the convection by the environment. It is shown that rate of destabilization, as well as instantaneous stability, work well for the dynamic control. Integrated moisture convergence leads to underprediction of rainfall rates and subsequent degrading of the results in terms of movement and structure of the mesoscale convective system (MCS). The feedback determines the modification of the environment by the convection, and in this study is considered together with the static control, which determines cloud properties. All feedback and static-control assumptions tested here seem very important for the prediction of sea level pressure and rainfall. The most crucial ones were downdrafts and lateral mixing. As an interesting by-product, it is shown that a very simplistic and computationally highly efficient convective parameterization scheme leads to a very realistic simulation of the MCS, if the scheme uses a stability closure, assumes a large cloud size, parameterizes moist downdrafts, and does not assume unrealistically law lateral mixing.},

First, we can use simple statistical methods to find the most probable solution. Second, the ensemble probability density function can be considered as an appropriate ``prior'' (a'priori density) for Bayesian data assimilation. Using this ``prior'', and information about observation likelihood, measured meteorological or climatological data can be directly assimilated into model fields.

Isoprene and monoterpenes were predicted to have a particularly strong impact on tropical regions, including central Africa. The 1996 Experiment for Regional Sources and Sinks of Oxidants (EXPRESSO) study included a number of experiments that improved our ability to predict isoprene and monoterpene emissions from central Africa. The results of these experiments have been incorporated into an isoprene emission model that predicts hourly emissions on a spatial scale of about 1 km2. The model uses procedures that are suitable for estimating global emissions but uses regional measurements to accurately parameterize the model. Comparisons with above-canopy aircraft and tower flux measurements demonstrate that the model can estimate emissions within a factor of 2 for regions where ground measurements of model inputs are available. The annual central African isoprene emission predicted by our revised model (35 Tg C) is only 14\% less than that predicted by our earlier model, but there are considerable differences in estimates of individual model variables. The models differ by more than a factor of 5 for specific times and locations, which indicates that there are large uncertainties in emission estimates for at least some locations and seasons. The good agreement obtained for the EXPRESSO study field sites, however, suggests that the model can predict reasonable estimates if representative field measurements are used to parameterize the model.},

  abstract = {Reactive gases and aerosols are produced by terrestrial ecosystems, processed within plant canopies, and can then be emitted into the above-canopy atmosphere. Estimates of the above-canopy fluxes are needed for quantitative earth system studies and assessments of past, present and future air quality and climate. The Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) is described and used to quantify net terrestrial biosphere emission of isoprene into the atmosphere. MEGAN is designed for both global and regional emission modeling and has global coverage with \textasciitilde 1 km\textsuperscript{2} spatial resolution. Field and laboratory investigations of the processes controlling isoprene emission are described and data available for model development and evaluation are summarized. The factors controlling isoprene emissions include biological, physical and chemical driving variables. MEGAN driving variables are derived from models and satellite and ground observations. Tropical broadleaf trees contribute almost half of the estimated global annual isoprene emission due to their relatively high emission factors and because they are often exposed to conditions that are conducive for isoprene emission. The remaining flux is primarily from shrubs which have a widespread distribution. The annual global isoprene emission estimated with MEGAN ranges from about 500 to 750 Tg isoprene (440 to 660 Tg carbon) depending on the driving variables which include temperature, solar radiation, Leaf Area Index, and plant functional type. The global annual isoprene emission estimated using the standard driving variables is \textasciitilde 600 Tg isoprene. Differences in driving variables result in emission estimates that differ by more than a factor of three for specific times and locations. It is difficult to evaluate isoprene emission estimates using the concentration distributions simulated using chemistry and transport models, due to the substantial uncertainties in other model components, but at least some global models produce reasonable results when using isoprene emission distributions similar to MEGAN estimates. In addition, comparison with isoprene emissions estimated from satellite formaldehyde observations indicates reasonable agreement. The sensitivity of isoprene emissions to earth system changes (e.g., climate and land-use) demonstrates the potential for large future changes in emissions. Using temperature distributions simulated by global climate models for year 2100, MEGAN estimates that isoprene emissions increase by more than a factor of two. This is considerably greater than previous estimates and additional observations are needed to evaluate and improve the methods used to predict future isoprene emissions.},

The latter is a nadir viewing passive grating imaging spectrometer. The mathematical inversion of the TROPOMI data yields retrievals of different trace gas and aerosol data products. The column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of methane (XCH\textsubscript{4}) is the product of interest to this study. The daily global coverage of the atmospheric methane mole fraction data enables the analysis of the methane distribution and variation on large scales and also to estimate surface emissions. The spatio-temporal high-resolution satellite data are potentially particularly valuable in remote regions, such as the Arctic, where few ground stations and in situ measurements are available. In addition to the operational Copernicus S5P total-column-averaged dry-air mole fraction methane data product developed by SRON, the scientific TROPOMI/WFMD algorithm data product v1.5 (WFMD product) was generated at the Institute of Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen. In this study we focus on the assessment of both S5P XCH\textsubscript{4} data products over Greenland and find that spatial maps of both products show distinct features along the coastlines. Anomalies up to and exceeding 100 ppb are observed and stand out in comparison to the otherwise smooth changes in the methane distribution. These features are more pronounced for the operational product compared to the WFMD product. The spatial patterns correlate with the difference between the GMTED2010 digital elevation model (DEM) used in the retrievals and a more recent topography dataset, indicating that inaccuracies in the assumed surface elevation are the origin of the observed features. These correlations are stronger for the WFMD product. In order to evaluate the impact of the topography dataset on the retrieval we reprocess the WFMD product with updated elevation data. We find that a significant reduction of the localized features when GMTED2010 is replaced by recent topography data over Greenland based on ICESat-2 data. This study shows the importance of the chosen topography data for retrieved dry-air mole fractions. The use of a DEM that is as accurate and as up to date as possible is advised for all S5P data products as well as for future missions which rely on a DEM as input data. A modification based on this study is planned to be introduced in the next version of the WFMD data product.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The software has been designed to be used flexibly with any two- or three-dimensional time-varying input. The application of high-level data formats, such as {$<$}code{$>$}Iris{$<$}/code{$>$} cubes or {$<$}code{$>$}xarray{$<$}/code{$>$} arrays, for input and output allows for convenient use of metadata in the tracking analysis and visualisation. Comprehensive analysis routines are provided to derive properties like cloud lifetimes or statistics of cloud properties along with tools to visualise the results in a convenient way. The application of tobac is presented in two examples. We first track and analyse scattered deep convective cells based on maximum vertical velocity and the three-dimensional condensate mixing ratio field in cloud-resolving model simulations. We also investigate the performance of the tracking algorithm for different choices of time resolution of the model output. In the second application, we show how the framework can be used to effectively combine information from two different types of datasets by simultaneously tracking convective clouds in model simulations and in geostationary satellite images based on outgoing longwave radiation. The tobac framework provides a flexible new way to include the evolution of the characteristics of individual clouds in a range of important analyses like model intercomparison studies or model assessment based on observational data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {WWLLN (World Wide Lightning Location Network) data on global lightning are used to investigate the increase of total lightning strokes at Arctic latitudes. We use the summertime data from June, July and August (JJA) which average {$>$}200,000 strokes each year above 65oN for the years 2010 \textendash{} 2020. We minimize the possible influence of WWLLN network detection efficiency increases by normalizing our results to the total global strokes during northern summer each year. The ratio of strokes occurring above a given latitude, compared to total global strokes, increases with time, indicating that the Arctic is becoming more influenced by lightning. We compare the increasing fraction of strokes with the NOAA global temperature anomaly, and find that the fraction of strokes above 65oN to total global strokes increases linearly with the temperature anomaly and grew by a factor of 3 as the anomaly increased from 0.65 to 0.95 degrees C.

In addition to the simple (WRF Single-Moment 3-class Microphysics scheme; WSM3) and mixed-phase (WRF Single-Moment 5-class Microphysics scheme; WSM5) schemes of the Hong et al., a more complex scheme with the inclusion of graupel as another predictive variable (WRF Single-Moment 6-class Microphysics scheme; WSM6) was developed. The characteristics of the three categories of WSMMPs were examined for an idealized storm case and a heavy rainfall event over Korea. In an idealized thunderstorm simulation, the overall evolutionary features of the storm are not sensitive to the number of hydrometeors in the WSMMPs; however, the evolution of surface precipitation is significantly influenced by the complexity in microphysics. A simulation experiment for a heavy rainfall event indicated that the evolution of the simulated precipitation with the inclusion of graupel (WSM6) is similar to that from the simple (WSM3) and mixed-phase (WSM5) microphysics in a low-resolution grid; however, in a high-resolution grid, the amount of rainfall increases and the peak intensity becomes stronger as the number of hydrometeors increases.},

Strokes over the ocean are found to be stronger on average than those over land with a sharp boundary along a majority of coastlines. A linear regression method is developed to account for the spatial and temporal variation of WWLLN in order to perform a multiyear and global analysis of stroke energy distributions. The results are corroborated with data from the Lightning Imaging Sensor, the Optical Transient Detector, and the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network. These systematic comparisons lead to the conclusion that there exists a strong difference in the energetics between land and ocean thunderstorms that results in a higher fraction of more powerful strokes over the oceans.},

Its goal was to better understand the factors driving current changes in Arctic atmospheric composition and climate, including (1) influx of mid-latitude pollution, (2) boreal forest fires, (3) aerosol radiative forcing, and (4) chemical processes. The June\textendash July deployment was preceded by one week of flights over California (ARCTAS-CARB) focused on (1) improving state emission inventories for greenhouse gases and aerosols, (2) providing observations to test and improve models of ozone and aerosol pollution. ARCTAS involved three aircraft: a DC-8 with a detailed chemical payload, a P-3 with an extensive aerosol and radiometric payload, and a B-200 with aerosol remote sensing instrumentation. The aircraft data augmented satellite observations of Arctic atmospheric composition, in particular from the NASA A-Train. The spring phase (ARCTAS-A) revealed pervasive Asian pollution throughout the Arctic as well as significant European pollution below 2 km. Unusually large Siberian fires in April 2008 caused high concentrations of carbonaceous aerosols and also affected ozone. Satellite observations of BrO column hotspots were found not to be related to Arctic boundary layer events but instead to tropopause depressions, suggesting the presence of elevated inorganic bromine (5\textendash 10 pptv) in the lower stratosphere. Fresh fire plumes from Canada and California sampled during the summer phase (ARCTAS-B) indicated low NO\textsubscript{x} emission factors from the fires, rapid conversion of NO\textsubscript{x} to PAN, no significant secondary aerosol production, and no significant ozone enhancements except when mixed with urban pollution.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In this study, we use World Wide Lightning Location Network data and investigate properties of more than 90 000 lightning strokes which hit northern Europe during an unusually stormy winter in 2014/15. Thunderstorm days with at least two strokes hitting an area of 0.5\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} \texttimes{} 0.5\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} occurred 5\textendash 13 times per month in the stormiest regions. Such frequency of thunderstorm days is about 5 times higher than the mean annual number calculated for the same region over winter months in 2008\textendash 2017. The number of individual winter lightning strokes was about 4 times larger than the long-term median calculated over the last decade. In the colder months of December, January and February, the mean energy of detected strokes was 2 orders of magnitude larger than the global mean stroke energy of 1 kJ. We show for the first time that winter superbolts with radiated electromagnetic energies above 1 MJ appeared at night and in the morning hours, while the diurnal distribution of all detected lightning was nearly uniform. We also show that the superbolts were often single stroke flashes and that their subsequent strokes never reached megajoule energies. The lightning strokes were concentrated above the ocean close to the western coastal areas. All these lightning characteristics presume anomalously efficient winter thundercloud charging in the eastern North Atlantic, especially at the sea\textendash land boundary. We found that the resulting unusual production of lightning could not be explained solely by an anomalously warm sea surface caused by a positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and by a starting super El Ni\~no event. Increased updraft strengths, which are believed to accompany the cold-to-warm transition phase of El Ni\~no, might have acted as another charging driver. We speculate that a combination of both these large-scale climatic events might have been needed to produce the observed enormous amount of winter lightning in winter 2014/15.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We present and discuss a new dataset of gridded emissions covering the historical period (1850\textendash 2000) in decadal increments at a horizontal resolution of 0.5\textdegree{} in latitude and longitude. The primary purpose of this inventory is to provide consistent gridded emissions of reactive gases and aerosols for use in chemistry model simulations needed by climate models for the Climate Model Intercomparison Program \#5 (CMIP5) in support of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report (AR5). Our best estimate for the year 2000 inventory represents a combination of existing regional and global inventories to capture the best information available at this point; 40 regions and 12 sectors are used to combine the various sources. The historical reconstruction of each emitted compound, for each region and sector, is then forced to agree with our 2000 estimate, ensuring continuity between past and 2000 emissions. Simulations from two chemistry-climate models are used to test the ability of the emission dataset described here to capture long-term changes in atmospheric ozone, carbon monoxide and aerosol distributions. The simulated long-term change in the Northern mid-latitudes surface and mid-troposphere ozone is not quite as rapid as observed. However, stations outside this latitude band show much better agreement in both present-day and long-term trend. The model simulations indicate that the concentration of carbon monoxide is underestimated at the Mace Head station; however, the long-term trend over the limited observational period seems to be reasonably well captured. The simulated sulfate and black carbon deposition over Greenland is in very good agreement with the ice-core observations spanning the simulation period. Finally, aerosol optical depth and additional aerosol diagnostics are shown to be in good agreement with previously published estimates and observations.},

Although increased human-induced emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases are certainly the main driving factor, air pollutants, such as aerosols and ozone, are also important. Air pollutants are transported to the Arctic, primarily from Eurasia, leading to high concentrations in winter and spring (Arctic haze). Local ship emissions and summertime boreal forest fires may also be important pollution sources. Aerosols and ozone could be perturbing the radiative budget of the Arctic through processes specific to the region: Absorption of solar radiation by aerosols is enhanced by highly reflective snow and ice surfaces; deposition of light-absorbing aerosols on snow or ice can decrease surface albedo; and tropospheric ozone forcing may also be contributing to warming in this region. Future increases in pollutant emissions locally or in mid-latitudes could further accelerate global warming in the Arctic.},

The statistical results show that lightning occurrences in China have increased, especially negative cloud-to-ground (\&minus;CG) flashes because positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) flashes account for only 5.1\&thinsp;\% of the total. In china, most of lightning currents range are in the \&minus;60\&thinsp;\textasciitilde\&thinsp;+60\&thinsp;kA, Lightning current between \&minus;10\&thinsp;\textasciitilde\&thinsp;+10\&thinsp;kA only accounted for small proportion of 0.6\&thinsp;\%.The average intensity of positive flashes is 64.2\&thinsp;kA, the average intensity of negative flashes is \&minus;40.28\&thinsp;kA.

Lightning frequency has obvious regional differences across the country; the high density lightning area is mainly distributed in south-central China, the south-central Yangtze River region and the eastern part of southwestern China. Seasonal variation in lightning activity is well defined, with few lightning occurrences in winter and a gradual but significant increase from spring to autumn in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River to the north, south and southwest. The ratio of positive to negative flashes is highest in winter.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is considered to be a global atmospheric background location with limited anthropogenic influences. However, the observed summertime surface O3 concentration on the TP is 25\% higher than that in highly polluted regions (e.g., southern China). Previous studies have suggested that lightning-produced NOx (LNOx) can affect the concentration of surface O3. We used the Weather Research and Forecasting coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model combined with satellite, ground-based, and airborne observations to evaluate the contribution of LNOx to the surface O3 budget on the TP. Our results showed that LNOx contributed approximately 15\% of the surface NOx emission on the TP in summer. Accordingly, the contribution of LNOx to the summertime surface daily maximum 8-h average (MDA8) O3 on the TP was 9.3 {$\pm$} 7.1 ppb, which was 17.5\% {$\pm$} 14.5\% of the total concentration of the surface MDA8 O3. In addition, our study found that the number of moles of NO produced per lightning flash (LNOx production efficiency) significantly affected the surface concentration of NOx, OH, and MDA8 O3. Increasing the LNOx production efficiency (PE) from 0 to 330 mol NO flash-1 increased the concentration of MDA8 O3 by up to 20\% on the TP. Our study revealed that lightning significantly affects the atmospheric chemical processes involving O3 on the TP.},

  abstract = {Abstract A two-dimensional, time-dependent cloud model has been used to simulate a moderate intensity thunderstorm for the High Plains region. Six forms of water substance (water vapor, cloud water, cloud ice, rain, snow and hail, i.e., graupel) are simulated. The model utilizes the ``bulk water'' microphysical parameterization technique to represent the precipitation fields which are all assumed to follow exponential size distribution functions. Autoconversion concepts are used to parameterize the collision-coalescence and collision-aggregation processes. Accretion processes involving the various forms of liquid and solid hydrometeors are simulated in this model. The transformation of cloud ice to snow through autoconversion (aggregation) and Bergeron process and subsequent accretional growth or aggregation to form hail are simulated. Hail is also produced by various contact mechanisms and via probabilistic freezing of raindrops. Evaporation (sublimation) is considered for all precipitation particles outside the cloud. The melting of hail and snow are included in the model. Wet and dry growth of hail and shedding of rain from hail are simulated. The simulations show that the inclusion of snow has improved the realism of the results compared to a model without snow. The formation of virga from cloud anvils is now modeled. Addition of the snow field has resulted in the inclusion of more diverse and physically sound mechanisms for initiating the hail field, yielding greater potential for distinguishing dominant embryo types characteristically different from warm- and cold-based clouds.},

Observed ozone abundances and their variability (geographic and temporal) agree to within 10\textendash 15 ppbv with records from sonde observations. MLS complements these (and other) observations with global coverage and simultaneous measurements of related parameters. Previously-reported phenomena such as the ozone "wave one" feature are clearly seen in the MLS observations, as is a double peak in ozone abundance over tropical East Africa, with enhanced abundances in both May to June and September to November. While repeatable seasonal cycles are seen in many regions, they are often accompanied by significant interannual variability. Ozone seasonal cycles in the southern tropics and subtropics tend to be more distinct (i.e., annually repeatable) than in the northern. By contrast, carbon monoxide shows distinct seasonal cycles in many northern subtropical regions, notably from India to the Eastern Pacific. Deep convection (as indicated by large values of IWC) is typically associated with reductions in upper tropospheric ozone. Convection over polluted regions is seen to significantly enhance upper tropospheric carbon monoxide. While some regions show statistically significant correlations among ozone, carbon monoxide and IWC, simple correlations fall well short of accounting for the observed variability. The observed interrelated variations and metrics of annual and interannual variability described here represent a new resource for validation of atmospheric chemistry models.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this time the instrument was tested and calibrated extensively. During this phase the geolocation calibration was validated using a dedicated measurement zoom mode. With the help of spacecraft manoeuvres the solar angle dependence of the irradiance radiometry was calibrated for both internal diffusers. This improved the results that were obtained on the ground significantly. Furthermore the orbital and long-term stability was tested for electronic gains, offsets, non-linearity, the dark current and the output of the internal light sources. The CCD output gain of the UV, UVIS and NIR detectors shows drifts over time which can be corrected in the Level 1b (L1b) processor. In-flight measurements also revealed inconsistencies in the radiometric calibration and degradation of the UV spectrometer. Degradation was also detected for the internal solar diffusers. Since the start of the nominal operations (E2) phase in orbit 2818 on 30 April 2018, regularly scheduled calibration measurements on the eclipse side of the orbit are used for monitoring and updates to calibration key data. This article reports on the main results of the commissioning phase, the in-flight calibration and the instrument's stability since launch. Insights from commissioning and in-flight monitoring have led to updates to the L1b processor and its calibration key data. The updated processor is planned to be used for nominal processing from late 2020 on.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In most global composition models, lightning flash rates used to calculate LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} are expressed in terms of convective cloud-top height via the Price and Rind (1992) (PR92) parameterisations for land and ocean, where the oceanic parameterisation is known to greatly underestimate flash rates. We conduct a critical assessment of flash-rate parameterisations that are based on cloud-top height and validate them within the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator \textendash{} United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol (ACCESS-UKCA) global chemistry\textendash climate model using the Lightning Imaging Sensor and Optical Transient Detector (LIS/OTD) satellite data. While the PR92 parameterisation for land yields satisfactory predictions, the oceanic parameterisation, as expected, underestimates the observed flash-rate density severely, yielding a global average over the ocean of 0.33 flashes s\textsuperscript{-1} compared to the observed 9.16 flashes s\textsuperscript{-1} and leading to LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} being underestimated proportionally. We formulate new flash-rate parameterisations following Boccippio's (2002) scaling relationships between thunderstorm electrical generator power and storm geometry coupled with available data. The new parameterisation for land performs very similarly to the corresponding PR92 one, as would be expected, whereas the new oceanic parameterisation simulates the flash-rate observations much more accurately, giving a global average over the ocean of 8.84 flashes s\textsuperscript{-1}. The use of the improved flash-rate parameterisations in ACCESS-UKCA changes the modelled tropospheric composition \textendash{} global LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} increases from 4.8 to 6.6 Tg N yr\textsuperscript{-1}; the ozone (O\textsubscript{3}) burden increases by 8.5 \%; there is an increase in the mid- to upper-tropospheric NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} by as much as 40 pptv, a 13 \% increase in the global hydroxyl radical (OH), a decrease in the methane lifetime by 6.7 \%, and a decrease in the lower-tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) by 3 \%\textendash 7 \%.

These instruments have an effective range between about 12 and 16 km depending upon site latitude and type of lightning and have separate registers for negative ground flashes, positive ground flashes, and cloud flashes. From the registrations we have obtained approximate values of the annual lightning total flash density, Nt, and the cloud flash-to-ground flash ratio, z, at each site. We have observed a well-marked variation of Nt with latitude from 61 km-2 yr-1 at 1\textdegree{} to 0.66 km-2 yr-1 at 60\textdegree{} latitude. Nt falls by a factor of about 10 for a 30\textdegree{} increase in latitude, in reasonable agreement with estimates based on satellite observations. Earlier studies concerning the latitudinal variation of z showed that z was high (about 6 to 9) in the tropics, was about 3 to 4 in the subtropics and temperate regions, and was about 1 to 1.5 at high latitudes. However, we have found tropical values of z in the range 0.5 to 3.4 (weighted mean 2.3 for latitude range 0\textdegree{} to 20\textdegree ) and similar values in subtropical and temperate regions (range from 1.1 to 3.8 and weighted mean 2.2 for the latitude range 20\textdegree{} to 40\textdegree ). At high latitudes (40\textdegree{} to 60\textdegree ) our measured values (range 1.0 to 1.5 and weighted mean 1.3) agree with the earlier studies. The weighting was by years of observation at the site. The mean of the values of z measured at 14 sites was 1.9. Values of z at 13 of the sites were within a factor of 2 of this mean. We estimate the global mean value of z to be 2.3, based on weighting site z values by site total flash density. We have compared lightning occurrence characteristics at eight sites between 60\textdegree N and 27\textdegree S.},

  abstract = {This study compared the detection capabilities of the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) and ground-based Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENL) over the contiguous United States (CONUS) from 25 April 2017 to 5 May 2018. GLM detection efficiency (DE) relative to ENL varied spatially with greater DE in the southeastern United States and lower DE in the Northern Plains. Regions with greater DE were often regions where most intracloud flashes had normal positive polarity, while lower DE regions frequently had inverted negative intracloud. According to the tripolar noninductive charging model, inverted intracloud flashes are lower altitude than normal intracloud flashes. This lower altitude flash may result in greater cloud scattering of the optical lightning signal, which at cloud top is less than the GLM detection limits. DE was generally also greater for greater absolute peak current flashes, which serves as a proxy for optical energy. Additionally, GLM observed flashes to be generally greater in area and duration in the eastern relative to the western CONUS, which may result in the greater DE. GLM DE was also varied with the solar zenith angle as greatest DE occurred at night. ENL DE relative to GLM was varied spatially over CONUS with greater DE over eastern CONUS. ENL DE was greater for flashes of greater GLM flash radiant energy, area, and duration.},

  abstract = {We interpret the distribution of tropical tropospheric ozone columns (TTOCs) from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) by using a global three-dimensional model of tropospheric chemistry (GEOS-CHEM) and additional information from in situ observations. The GEOS-CHEM TTOCs capture 44\% of the variance of monthly mean TOMS TTOCs from the convective cloud differential method (CCD) with no global bias. Major discrepancies are found over northern Africa and south Asia where the TOMS TTOCs do not capture the seasonal enhancements from biomass burning found in the model and in aircraft observations. A characteristic feature of these northern tropical enhancements, in contrast to southern tropical enhancements, is that they are driven by the lower troposphere where the sensitivity of TOMS is poor due to Rayleigh scattering. We develop an efficiency correction to the TOMS retrieval algorithm that accounts for the variability of ozone in the lower troposphere. This efficiency correction increases TTOCs over biomass burning regions by 3\textendash 5 Dobson units (DU) and decreases them by 2\textendash 5 DU over oceanic regions, improving the agreement between CCD TTOCs and in situ observations. Applying the correction to CCD TTOCs reduces by {$\sim$}5 DU the magnitude of the ``tropical Atlantic paradox'' [Thompson et al., 2000], i.e. the presence of a TTOC enhancement over the southern tropical Atlantic during the northern African biomass burning season in December\textendash February. We reproduce the remainder of the paradox in the model and explain it by the combination of upper tropospheric ozone production from lightning NOx, persistent subsidence over the southern tropical Atlantic as part of the Walker circulation, and cross-equatorial transport of upper tropospheric ozone from northern midlatitudes in the African ``westerly duct.'' These processes in the model can also account for the observed 13\textendash 17 DU persistent wave-1 pattern in TTOCs with a maximum over the tropical Atlantic and a minimum over the tropical Pacific during all seasons. The photochemical effects of mineral dust have only a minor role on the modeled distribution of TTOCs, including over northern Africa, due to multiple competing effects. The photochemical effects of mineral dust globally decrease annual mean OH concentrations by 9\%. A global lightning NOx source of 6 Tg N yr-1 in the model produces a simulation that is most consistent with TOMS and in situ observations.},

Data from this campaign provided an opportunity to examine and improve our understanding of atmospheric photochemical oxidation processes related to the formation of secondary air pollutants such as ozone (O3). O3 production and its sensitivity to NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were calculated at different locations and times of day. Ozone production efficiency (OPE), defined as the ratio of the ozone production rate to the NOx oxidation rate, was calculated using the observations and the simulation results of the box and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. Correlations of these results with other parameters, such as radical sources and NOx mixing ratio, were also evaluated. It was generally found that O3 production tends to be more VOC-sensitive in the morning along with high ozone production rates, suggesting that control of VOCs may be an effective way to control O3 in Houston. In the afternoon, O3 production was found to be mainly NOx-sensitive with some exceptions. O3 production near major emissions sources such as Deer Park was mostly VOC-sensitive for the entire day, other urban areas near Moody Tower and Channelview were VOC-sensitive or in the transition regime, and areas farther from downtown Houston such as Smith Point and Conroe were mostly NOx-sensitive for the entire day. It was also found that the control of NOx emissions has reduced O3 concentrations over Houston but has led to larger OPE values. The results from this work strengthen our understanding of O3 production; they indicate that controlling NOx emissions will provide air quality benefits over the greater Houston metropolitan area in the long run, but in selected areas controlling VOC emissions will also be beneficial.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} In recent years, the pan-Arctic region has experienced increasingly extreme fire seasons. Fires in the northern high latitudes are driven by current and future climate change, lightning, fuel conditions, and human activity. In this context, conceptualizing and parameterizing current and future Arctic fire regimes will be important for fire and land management as well as understanding current and predicting future fire emissions. The objectives of this review were driven by policy questions identified by the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) Working Group and posed to its Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers. This review synthesizes current understanding of the changing Arctic and boreal fire regimes, particularly as fire activity and its response to future climate change in the pan-Arctic have consequences for Arctic Council states aiming to mitigate and adapt to climate change in the north. The conclusions from our synthesis are the following. (1) Current and future Arctic fires, and the adjacent boreal region, are driven by natural (i.e. lightning) and human-caused ignition sources, including fires caused by timber and energy extraction, prescribed burning for landscape management, and tourism activities. Little is published in the scientific literature about cultural burning by Indigenous populations across the pan-Arctic, and questions remain on the source of ignitions above 70\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} N in Arctic Russia. (2) Climate change is expected to make Arctic fires more likely by increasing the likelihood of extreme fire weather, increased lightning activity, and drier vegetative and ground fuel conditions. (3) To some extent, shifting agricultural land use and forest transitions from forest\textendash steppe to steppe, tundra to taiga, and coniferous to deciduous in a warmer climate may increase and decrease open biomass burning, depending on land use in addition to climate-driven biome shifts. However, at the country and landscape scales, these relationships are not well established. (4) Current black carbon and PM\textsubscript{2.5} emissions from wildfires above 50 and 65\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} N are larger than emissions from the anthropogenic sectors of residential combustion, transportation, and flaring. Wildfire emissions have increased from 2010 to 2020, particularly above 60\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} N, with 56 \% of black carbon emissions above 65\textsuperscript{{$\circ$}} N in 2020 attributed to open biomass burning \textendash{} indicating how extreme the 2020 wildfire season was and how severe future Arctic wildfire seasons can potentially be. (5) What works in the boreal zones to prevent and fight wildfires may not work in the Arctic. Fire management will need to adapt to a changing climate, economic development, the Indigenous and local communities, and fragile northern ecosystems, including permafrost and peatlands. (6) Factors contributing to the uncertainty of predicting and quantifying future Arctic fire regimes include underestimation of Arctic fires by satellite systems, lack of agreement between Earth observations and official statistics, and still needed refinements of location, conditions, and previous fire return intervals on peat and permafrost landscapes. This review highlights that much research is needed in order to understand the local and regional impacts of the changing Arctic fire regime on emissions and the global climate, ecosystems, and pan-Arctic communities.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Cloud electrification leads to the production of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which has an effect on ozone concentrations. Currently large uncertainties exist regarding the contribution of lightning to the global and local NOx budget, even on a per flash basis. Most lightning NOx (LNOx) models distribute the LNOx at reflectivities (Z){$\geq$}20dBZ in the horizontal, while vertically, a Gaussian distribution function with a peak at -15\textdegree C is used for cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes and a bimodal distribution function with peaks at -15\textdegree C and -45\textdegree C is used for inter- and intra-cloud (IC) flashes. This research aims to improve our basic understanding of lightning location relative to radar Z as a function of storm and flash type. Using data from the North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array (NALMA) and the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor data suite, the results from analyzing a multicell storm, mesoscale convective system and supercell storm showed that 29.7\%, 15.9\% and 6.9\% of all flashes initiated in regions where Z{$<$}20dBZ, respectively. The bimodal lightning initiation distribution for IC flashes was also not observed for any of the three storms. In addition, it is shown that when incorporating the propagation of the flash, the percentage of NALMA lightning sources located in regions where Z{$<$}20dBZ increases. Finally, when comparing flash types, the results show that Hybrid flashes have consistently larger sizes than IC and CG flashes, while IC and Hybrid flashes tend to have more sources located at Z{$<$}20dBZ than CG flashes.},

  abstract = {In this work, a new parameterization of the thunderstorm cloud electrical flash frequency is obtained on the basis of simple dimensional arguments. The flash frequency is expressed as a power function of both the cloud top height and the cloud droplet concentration, thus partly taking into account the role of the microphysical cloud characteristics. Since droplet concentrations are not predicted by General Circulation Models (GCMs) and further show great variability, two different ``standard'' droplet concentrations, respectively valid for continental and maritime thunderstorms, are used. A numerical experiment has been made by using the METEO-France GCM ``ARPEGE'' in relation to both, this new parameterization and the Price and Rind (1992) parameterization, in order to determine the global characteristics of electrical flashes. The analysis of the results reveals that the mean annual global flash frequency as well as the total number of flashes that strike annually the globe are higher when the new parameterization is used but are in better agreement with the Optical Transient Detector (OTD) (Christian et al., 1996) observations, thus indirectly attesting for its validity. Further, the good agreement between monthly and diurnal global flash numbers and the corresponding OTD observations confirms the ability of ``ARPEGE'' of correctly representing the global thunderstorm development. Finally, the new parameterization has been used in a second numerical experiment in order to infer the role of a doubling of CO2 on the global distribution of electrical flashes. A 10\% increase of the mean global annual flash frequency is obtained for a surface warming of roughly 2\textdegree C.},

Details of the changes in parameterizations subsequent to the version in the original MERRA reanalysis are presented here. Results of a series of atmosphere-only sensitivity studies are shown to demonstrate changes in simulated climate associated with specific changes in physical parameterizations, and the impact of the newly implemented resolution-aware behavior on simulations at different resolutions is demonstrated. The GEOS-5 AGCM presented here is the model used as part of the GMAO MERRA2 reanalysis, global mesoscale simulations at 10 km resolution through 1.5 km resolution, the real-time numerical weather prediction system, and for atmosphere-only, coupled ocean-atmosphere and coupled atmosphere-chemistry simulations.   The seasonal mean climate of the MERRA2 version of the GEOS-5 AGCM represents a substantial improvement over the simulated climate of the MERRA version at all resolutions and for all applications. Fundamental improvements in simulated climate are associated with the increased re-evaporation of frozen precipitation and cloud condensate, resulting in a wetter atmosphere. Improvements in simulated climate are also shown to be attributable to changes in the background gravity wave drag, and to upgrades in the relationship between the ocean surface stress and the ocean roughness. The series of resolution-aware parameters related to the moist physics was shown to result in improvements at higher resolutions and result in AGCM simulations that exhibit seamless behavior across different resolutions and applications.},

It generates near-real-time analyzed data products, reanalyses, and weather and seasonal forecasts to support research targeted to understanding interactions among Earth System processes. For chemistry, our efforts are focused on ozone and its influence on the state of the atmosphere and oceans, and on trace gas data assimilation and global forecasting at mesoscale discretization. Several chemistry and aerosol modules are coupled to the GCM, which enables GEOS to address topics pertinent to NASA's Earth Science Mission. This paper describes the atmospheric chemistry components of GEOS and provides an overview of its Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)-based software infrastructure, which promotes a rich spectrum of feedbacks that influence circulation and climate, and impact human and ecosystem health. We detail how GEOS allows model users to select chemical mechanisms and emission scenarios at run time, establish the extent to which the aerosol and chemical components communicate, and decide whether either or both influence the radiative transfer calculations. A variety of resolutions facilitates research on spatial and temporal scales relevant to problems ranging from hourly changes in air quality to trace gas trends in a changing climate. Samples of recent GEOS chemistry applications are provided.},

Its impact on tropospheric circulation causes significant changes to the distribution of ozone. Here we derive the lower tropospheric to lower stratospheric ozone response to ENSO from observations by the Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) instruments, both on the Aura satellite, and compare to the simulated response from the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model (GEOSCCM). Measurement ozone sensitivity is derived using multiple linear regression to include variations from ENSO as well as from the first two empirical orthogonal functions of the quasi-biennial oscillation. Both measurements and simulation show features such as the negative ozone sensitivity to ENSO over the tropospheric tropical Pacific and positive ozone sensitivity over Indonesia and the Indian Ocean region. Ozone sensitivity to ENSO is generally positive over the midlatitude lower stratosphere, with greater sensitivity in the Northern Hemisphere. GEOSCCM reproduces both the overall pattern and magnitude of the ozone response to ENSO obtained from observations. We demonstrate the combined use of ozone measurements from MLS and TES to quantify the lower atmospheric ozone response to ENSO and suggest its possible usefulness in evaluating chemistry-climate models.},

A common approach is to transport gases using the winds from meteorological analyses, either using them directly in a chemical transport model or by constraining the flow in a general circulation model. Here we compare the transport of idealized tracers in several different models that use the same meteorological fields taken from Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA). We show that, even though the models use the same meteorological fields, there are substantial differences in their global-scale tropospheric transport related to large differences in parameterized convection between the simulations. Furthermore, we find that the transport differences between simulations constrained with the same-large scale flow are larger than differences between free-running simulations, which have differing large-scale flow but much more similar convective mass fluxes. Our results indicate that more attention needs to be paid to convective parameterizations in order to understand large-scale tropospheric transport in models, particularly in simulations constrained with analyzed winds.},

Using the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream V research aircraft, the experiment investigated the photochemical environment over the tropical western Pacific (TWP) warm pool, a region of massive deep convection and the major pathway for air to enter the stratosphere during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter. The new observations provide a wealth of information for quantifying the influence of convection on the vertical distributions of active species. The airborne in situ measurements up to 15 km altitude fill a significant gap by characterizing the abundance and altitude variation of a wide suite of trace gases. These measurements, together with observations of dynamical and microphysical parameters, provide significant new data for constraining and evaluating global chemistry climate models. Measurements include precursor and product gas species of reactive halogen compounds that impact ozone in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. High accuracy, in-situ measurements of ozone obtained during CONTRAST quantify ozone concentration profiles in the UT, where previous observations from balloon-borne ozonesondes were often near or below the limit of detection. CONTRAST was one of the three coordinated experiments to observe the TWP during January-February 2014. Together, CONTRAST, ATTREX and CAST, using complementary capabilities of the three aircraft platforms as well as ground-based instrumentation, provide a comprehensive quantification of the regional distribution and vertical structure of natural and pollutant trace gases in the TWP during NH winter, from the oceanic boundary to the lower stratosphere.},

Lightning produces between 2 and 8 Tg N yr\textsuperscript{-1} globally and on average about 250 {$\pm$} 150 mol NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} per flash. In this work, we estimate the moles of NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} produced per flash (LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} production efficiency) in the Pyrenees (Spain, France and Andorra) and in the Ebro Valley (Spain) by using nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) and cloud properties from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) as well as lightning data from the Earth Networks Global Lightning Network (ENGLN) and from the EUropean Co-operation for LIghtning Detection (EUCLID). The Pyrenees are one of the areas in Europe with the highest lightning frequencies, which, along with their remoteness as well as their very low NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} background, enables us to better distinguish the LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} signal produced by recent lightning in TROPOMI NO\textsubscript{2} measurements. We compare the LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} production efficiency estimates for eight convective systems in 2018 using two different sets of TROPOMI research products provided by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and the Deutsches Zentrum f\"ur Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR). According to our results, the mean LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} production efficiency in the Pyrenees and in the Ebro Valley, using a 3 h chemical lifetime, ranges between 14 and 103 mol NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} per flash from the eight systems. The mean LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} production efficiency estimates obtained using both TROPOMI products and ENGLN lightning data differ by {$\sim$} 23 \%, while they differ by {$\sim$} 35 \% when using EUCLID lightning data. The main sources of uncertainty when using ENGLN lightning data are the estimation of background NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} that is not produced by lightning and the time window before the TROPOMI overpass that is used to count the total number of lightning flashes contributing to freshly produced LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}}. The main source of uncertainty when using EUCLID lightning data is the uncertainty in the detection efficiency of EUCLID.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We have constructed profiles of lightning NO{$\chi$} mass distribution for use in specifying the effective lightning NO{$\chi$} source in global and regional chemical transport models. The profiles have been estimated for midlatitude continental, tropical continental, and tropical marine regimes based on profiles computed for individual storms in each regime. In order to construct these profiles we have developed a parameterization for lightning occurrence, lightning type, flash placement, and NO{$\chi$} production in a cloud-scale tracer transport model using variables computed in the two-dimensional Goddard Cumulus Ensemble (GCE) model. Wind fields from the GCE model are used to redistribute the lightning NO{$\chi$} throughout the duration of the storm. Our method produces reasonable results in terms of computed flash rates and NO{$\chi$} mixing ratios compared with observations. The profiles for each storm are computed by integrating the lightning NO{$\chi$} mass across the cloud model domain for each model layer at the end of the storm. The results for all three regimes show a maximum in the mass profile in the upper troposphere, usually within 2\textendash 4 km of the tropopause. Downdrafts appear to be the strongest in the simulated midlatitude continental systems, evidenced by substantial lightning NO{$\chi$} mass (up to 23\%) in the lowest kilometer. Tropical systems, particularly those over marine areas, tended to have a greater fraction of intracloud flashes and weaker downdrafts, causing only minor amounts of NO{$\chi$} to remain in the boundary layer following a storm. Minima appear in the profiles typically in the 2\textendash 5 km layer. Even though a substantial portion of the NO{$\chi$} is produced by cloud-to-ground flashes in the lowest 6 km, at the end of the storm most of the NO{$\chi$} is in the upper troposphere (55\textendash 75\% above 8 km) in agreement with observations. With most of the effective lightning NO{$\chi$} source in the upper troposphere where the NO{$\chi$} lifetime is several days, substantial photochemical O3 production is expected in this layer downstream of regions of deep convection containing lightning. We demonstrate that the effect on upper tropospheric NO{$\chi$} and O3 is substantial when the vertical distribution of the lightning NO{$\chi$} source in a global model is changed from uniform to being specified by our profiles. Uncertainties in a number of aspects of our parameterization are discussed.},

The 29 observations, covering a latitude range 69\textdegree N to 37\textdegree S, gave a mean value of z of 3.35. The empirical relationship proposed between z and {$\lambda$} is z{$\lambda\lambda\lambda$} From 26 pairs of values of z and T, covering the range 5 to 81 thunderdays per year, the proposed relationship is zTTT zT Information on z for high latitudes is sparse. It is probable that z lies between 1 and 2 for {$\lambda$} {$>$} 60\textdegree{} and T {$<$} 10. The existence of a relationship between z and T is attributed to the fact that both are related to latitude. The relationship between z and {$\lambda$} probably depends on the variation of freezing level height with latitude, and a possible relationship between z and freezing level height is examined. Where both {$\lambda$} and T are known, the proposed estimate of z for {$\lambda$} up to 60\textdegree{} and T up to 84 is z{$\lambda$}T{$\lambda$}T{$\lambda$}},

  abstract = {This paper begins a study on the role of lightning in maintaining the global distribution of nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the troposphere. It presents the first global and seasonal distributions of lightning-produced NOx (LNOx) based on the observed distribution of electrical storms and the physical properties of lightning strokes. We derive a global rate for cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes of 20\textendash 30 flashes/s with a mean energy per flash of 6.7\texttimes 109 J. Intracloud (IC) flashes are more frequent, 50\textendash 70 flashes/s but have 10\% of the energy of CG strokes and, consequently, produce significantly less NOx. It appears to us that the majority of previous studies have mistakenly assumed that all lightning flashes produce the same amount of NOx, thus overestimating the NOx production by a factor of 3. On the other hand, we feel these same studies have underestimated the energy released in CG flashes, resulting in two negating assumptions. For CG energies we adopt a production rate of 10\texttimes 1016 molecules NO/J based on the current literature. Using a method to simulate global lightning frequencies from satellite-observed cloud data, we have calculated the LNOx on various spatial (regional, zonal, meridional, and global) and temporal scales (daily, monthly, seasonal, and interannual). Regionally, the production of LNOx is concentrated over tropical continental regions, predominantly in the summer hemisphere. The annual mean production rate is calculated to be 12.2 Tg N/yr, and we believe it extremely unlikely that this number is less than 5 or more than 20 Tg N/yr. Although most of LNOx, is produced in the lowest 5 km by CG lightning, convective mixing in the thunderstorms is likely to deposit large amounts of NOx, in the upper troposphere where it is important in ozone production. On an annual basis, 64\% of the LNOx, is produced in the northern hemisphere, implying that the northern hemisphere should have natural ozone levels as much as 2 times greater than the southern hemisphere, even before anthropogenic influences. The amount of O3 produced from this NOx is expected to exceed the stratospheric source by a factor of 1.5, and thus the hemispheric asymmetry in LNOx would lead to a significant excess of northern hemisphere O3 even in the preindustrial troposphere. (The monthly climatologies for LNOx on a 1\textdegree\texttimes 1\textdegree{} latitude-longitude grid can be obtained by e-mail to cprice@flash.tau.ac.il).},

Will lightning activity increase in a warmer world? Since the majority of global lightning activity occurs in the tropics, changes in future global lightning activity will depend on changes in the tropical climate. The latest IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 2007] projections show a partial drying out of the tropical landmasses as the global climate gets warmer. This is caused by both changes in rainfall patterns, but also due to increases in evapo-transpiration. We would expect a drier climate to produce fewer thunderstorms, and less lightning. However, experimental and modeling studies have shown that as tropical regions dry in the present climate, they experience greater lightning activity. This paradox may be explained by noting that while drier climate conditions result in fewer thunderstorms and less rainfall, the thunderstorms that do occur are more explosive, resulting in more lightning activity.},

Numerous studies report that the Arctic is warming either twice, more than twice, or even three times as fast as the globe on average. Here we show, by using several observational datasets which cover the Arctic region, that during the last 43 years the Arctic has been warming nearly four times faster than the globe, which is a higher ratio than generally reported in literature. We compared the observed Arctic amplification ratio with the ratio simulated by state-of-the-art climate models, and found that the observed four-fold warming ratio over 1979\textendash 2021 is an extremely rare occasion in the climate model simulations. The observed and simulated amplification ratios are more consistent with each other if calculated over a longer period; however the comparison is obscured by observational uncertainties before 1979. Our results indicate that the recent four-fold Arctic warming ratio is either an extremely unlikely event, or the climate models systematically tend to underestimate the amplification.},

The wide energy and length scale ranges which are covered herein includes and exceeds the ones of first and subsequent return strokes happening during lightning discharges. An emphasis is put on the NOx production and the optical power emitted by strong shocks as the ones generated by Joule heating of the air from intense current flows. The production rate of NOx, which is useful for atmospheric global modeling, is found to be between 4.5 \texttimes{} 1016 and 8.6 \texttimes{} 1016 molecules/J for all computed cases, which is in agreement with the literature. Two different radiation transport methods are used to characterize the variability of the results according to the radiation transport method. With the exact radiation solver, we show that between 15 and 40\% of the energy is lost by radiation, with a percentage between 20 and 25\% for averaged lightning energies. The maximal visible peak is between 7 \texttimes{} 108 W/m and 3 \texttimes{} 107 W/m obtained for, respectively, a 19 kJ/cm and a 28 J/cm energy input. The mean radiated powers in the visible range are found between 9 \texttimes{} 106 W/m and 2 \texttimes{} 105 W/m for the energies just mentioned. We discuss the agreement of these values with previous studies.},

  abstract = {An experimental VLF WorldWide Lightning Location (WWLL) network is being developed to provide realtime locations of cloud to ground lightning discharges occurring throughout the globe. This network has expanded from a limited number of stations in the Western Pacific to its current state of 11 stations, in most longitude sectors, with additional stations planned in the near future. As part of the initial testing phase of the WWLL the network has operated in a simple mode, sending the station trigger times into a central processing point rather than using the sferic Time of Group Arrival (TOGA). During this initial stage, a significant quantity of lightning location data has been collected, some of which is being applied to research questions. In this paper the operation of the WWLL network is described, and the location accuracy of the pre-TOGA WWLL network is characterised. This is performed by contrasting commercial lightning location data from an Australian network, Kattron, over 2 days in January 2002, with 4 WWLL stations covering the same region. It was found that there were 426 matched lightning events, corresponding to lightning discharges with large lightning return stroke peak currents (mean absolute peak current of {$\sim$}26 kA compared with {$\sim$}12 kA for all Kattron events). By considering the random errors in the difference locations between the matching lightning events, an appropriate Gaussian timing error for the WWLL network of receiving stations is determined, and hence an estimate for the global location errors for the existing 11-station network is found. The ``worst-case'' global location error for the existing network ranges spatially from 7.5\textendash 100 km, with the global median being 15 km, and the global mean 30 km. When the TOGA method is implemented, the station timing errors will decrease, allowing for an increase in the location accuracies. Hence, the location accuracy estimates determined in this paper will be very conservative for the future WWLL network employing the TOGA technique.},

VLF waves propagate through the Earth-ionosphere waveguide with relatively low attenuation, enabling the detection of these radio atmospherics at great distances from the lightning discharge. A new technique of long-range ({$\leq$}6000 km) global lightning geolocation via sferic detection is presented. This new technique catalogs the dominant variation in expected received waveforms in a set of waveform banks, which are then used to estimate the propagation distance and accurately determine the arrival time. Using three sensors in a trial network, this new technique is used to demonstrate a median accuracy of 1\textendash 4 km, depending on the time of day. An overall cloud-to-ground (CG) stroke detection efficiency between {$\sim$}40 and 60\% is estimated by correlating individual lightning stroke events to data from the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). Additional events reported by the trial network are shown to have a tight spatial clustering to storm clusters identified by NLDN, suggesting that many of the unmatched events correspond to weak cloud-to-ground strokes, M components, or cloud pulses. Exploiting an empirical correlation between peak VLF field strength and peak current values reported by NLDN, we also provide unvalidated estimates of the peak current and lightning channel polarity. The trial network does not distinguish between cloud and ground discharges, so these peak current estimates only relate to an Earth-referenced channel current for the subset of reported events that are return strokes.},

The data set, composed of 353 million flashes, was compared with the National Lightning Detection NetworkTM for peak current accuracy, location accuracy, and detection efficiency. The validation results demonstrated a mean (geometric mean) peak current magnitude error of 21\% (6\%), a median location accuracy of 2.5 km, and a relative ground flash detection efficiency of 57\% averaged over all positive and negative reference flashes, and 67\% for all reference flashes above 15 kA. The distribution of peak currents for negative flashes shifts to higher magnitudes over the ocean. Three case study 10\textdegree\texttimes 10\textdegree{} regions are analyzed, in which the peak current enhancement is extremely sharp at the coastline, suggesting that the higher peak currents for oceanic lightning cannot be solely attributable to network artifacts such as detection efficiency and peak current estimation error. In these regions, the geometric mean and 95th percentile of the peak current distribution for negative cloud to ocean flashes is 22\%\textendash 88\% and 65\%\textendash 121\% higher, respectively, compared to cloud to ground flashes in nearby land regions. Globally, the majority of all negative flashes with estimated peak current magnitude above 75 kA occur over the ocean.},

  abstract = {Air pollution in the Arctic caused by local emission sources is a challenge that is important but often overlooked. Local Arctic air pollution can be severe and significantly exceed air quality standards, impairing public health and affecting ecosystems. Specifically in the wintertime, pollution can accumulate under inversion layers. However, neither the contributing emission sources are well identified and quantified nor the relevant atmospheric mechanisms forming pollution are well understood. In the summer, boreal forest fires cause high levels of atmospheric pollution. Despite the often high exposure to air pollution, there are neither specific epidemiological nor toxicological health impact studies in the Arctic. Hence, effects on the local population are difficult to estimate at present. Socioeconomic development of the Arctic is already occurring and expected to be significant in the future. Arctic destination shipping is likely to increase with the development of natural resource extraction, and tourism might expand. Such development will not only lead to growth in the population living in the Arctic but will likely increase emission types and magnitudes. Present-day inventories show a large spread in the amount and location of emissions representing a significant source of uncertainty in model predictions that often deviate significantly from observations. This is a challenge for modeling studies that aim to assess the impacts of within Arctic air pollution. Prognoses for the future are hence even more difficult, given the additional uncertainty of estimating emissions based on future Arctic economic development scenarios.},

  abstract = {We estimate the tropospheric column ozone using a forward trajectory model to increase the horizontal resolution of the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) derived stratospheric column ozone. Subtracting the MLS stratospheric column from Ozone Monitoring Instrument total column measurements gives the trajectory enhanced tropospheric ozone residual (TTOR). Because of different tropopause definitions, we validate the basic residual technique by computing the 200-hPa-to-surface column and comparing it to the same product from ozonesondes and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer measurements. Comparisons show good agreement in the tropics and reasonable agreement at middle latitudes, but there is a persistent low bias in the TTOR that may be due to a slight high bias in MLS stratospheric column. With the improved stratospheric column resolution, we note a strong correlation of extratropical tropospheric ozone column anomalies with probable troposphere-stratosphere exchange events or folds. The folds can be identified by their colocation with strong horizontal tropopause gradients. TTOR anomalies due to folds may be mistaken for pollution events since folds often occur in the Atlantic and Pacific pollution corridors. We also compare the 200-hPa-to-surface column with Global Modeling Initiative chemical model estimates of the same quantity. While the tropical comparisons are good, we note that chemical model variations in 200-hPa-to-surface column at middle latitudes are much smaller than seen in the TTOR.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present lightning statistics for more than three million cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes located during the 10-year operation period 1992\textendash 2001 of the Austrian lightning location system (LLS) called ALDIS (Austrian Lightning Detection and Information System). Like a majority of other LLS operated worldwide, ALDIS underwent configuration changes and continuous performance improvement. Since these changes can alter the lightning statistics, we also relate the variation of the individual lightning parameters during the period of operation to changes in ALDIS configuration and performance. This analysis should be useful to other network operators and data users. Flash densities in Austria are normally between 0.5 and 4 flashes km-2 yr-1 depending on terrain. Flashes are classified as negative, positive, or bipolar. Seventeen percent of the flashes were classified as positive, and 2.3\% of the total number of flashes were bipolar. Fifty percent of the positive multiple-stroke flashes were bipolar flashes with positive first stroke; this influences the positive flash multiplicity and interstroke interval statistics. Compared to many other networks, the ALDIS network reports much lower median negative peak currents. For 2001, the median first-stroke peak current for negative flashes was 10 kA. Estimated multiplicity of negative flashes for the 10-year period is affected by the algorithm that groups strokes into flashes, as well as the improved DE of the network as a result of the integration of ALDIS into the European LLS (EUCLID). This performance improvement also resulted in a higher number of single-stroke flashes. Interstroke interval and median first-stroke peak current show a clear correlation with multiplicity for negative flashes, irrespective of detection efficiency. Negative flashes with higher multiplicity show smaller average interstroke intervals and larger first stroke median peak currents. No correlation between interstroke interval and stroke order was found. On average, regions with higher flash density show slightly higher flash multiplicity.},

We further examined the photochemistry of INP and identified propanone nitrate (PROPNN) and isoprene nitrooxy hydroxyepoxide (INHE) as the main products.

The Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) has developed a working NO2 sonde. The sonde is attached to a small meteorological balloon and measures a tropospheric NO2 profile. The NO2 sonde has a vertical resolution of 5 m and a measurement range between 1 and 100 ppbv. The instrument is light in weight (0.7 kg), cheap (disposable), energy efficient and not harmful to the environment or the person who finds the package after use. The sonde uses the chemiluminescent reaction of NO2 in an aqueous luminol solution. The NO2-luminol reaction produces faint blue/purple light (at about 425 nm), which is detected by an array of silicon photodiodes. The luminol solution is optimised to be specific to NO2.   An on-ground comparison with measurements from a Photolytic Analyser of The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) shows that both instruments measure similar NO2 variations in ambient air.   During the Cabauw Intercomparison campaign of Nitrogen Dioxide measuring instruments (CINDI) in June/July 2009, six vertical profiles of NO2 from the ground to a 5 km altitude were measured, which clearly show that the largest amount of NO2 is measured in the boundary layer. The measured boundary layer heights of the NO2 sonde are in good agreement with boundary layer heights determined by a LD40 Ceilometer at Cabauw.},

The experiments have shown that the performance characteristics of the two ECC-sonde types can be significantly different, even when operated under the same conditions. Particularly above 20 km the ENSCI-Z sonde tends to measure 5\textendash 10\% more ozone than the SPC-6A sonde. Below 20 km the differences are 5\% or less, but appear to show some differences with year of manufacture. There is a significant difference in the ozone readings when sondes of the same type are operated with different cathode sensing solutions. Testing the most commonly used sensing solutions showed that for each ECC-manufacturer type the use of 1.0\% KI and full buffer gives 5\% larger ozone values compared with the use of 0.5\% KI and half buffer, and as much as 10\% larger values compared with 2.0\% KI and no buffer. For ozone sounding stations performing long term measurements this means that changing the sensing solution type or ECC-sonde type can easily introduce a change of {$\pm$}5\% or more in their records, affecting determination of ozone trends. Standardization of operating procedures for ECC-sondes yields a precision better than {$\pm$}(3\textendash 5)\% and an accuracy of about {$\pm$}(5\textendash 10)\% up to 30 km altitude.},

The results are consistent with real terrain features. In a more general way, the proposed methodology illustrates the segmentation approach provided by the morphological watershed mapping. Zusammenfassung Die Bassinbeschreibung ist eine wesentliche Vorstufe bei der hydrologischen Modellbildung und der Lenkung der Wasserverteilung. Vorgestellt wird ein effizientes Verfahren zur Beschreibung topographischer Bassins mit Hilfe digitaler Elevationsmodelle. Es beruht auf mathematischer Morphologia, und es besteht aus zwei gr\"o\ss eren Schritten. Zuerst werden alle Senken im Modell entfernt, indem eine neuartige morphologische Abbildung verwendet wird. Sodann werden topographische Bassins beschrieben unter Verwendung morphologischer Ausd\"unnung mit Hilfe bestimmter Strukturierungs-elemente. Die Ergebnisse sind konsistent mit realen Terraineigenschaften. Die vorgeschlagene Vorgehensweise illustriert auf eine allgemeinere Art den Segmentierungsansatz, den die morphologische Abbildung der Wasserverteilung zur Verf\"ugung stellt.

  abstract = {Ozone pollution in the Southeast US involves complex chemistry driven by emissions of anthropogenic nitrogen oxide radicals (NOx {$\equiv$} NO + NO2) and biogenic isoprene. Model estimates of surface ozone concentrations tend to be biased high in the region and this is of concern for designing effective emission control strategies to meet air quality standards. We use detailed chemical observations from the SEAC4RS aircraft campaign in August and September 2013, interpreted with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25\textdegree\texttimes 0.3125\textdegree{} horizontal resolution, to better understand the factors controlling surface ozone in the Southeast US. We find that the National Emission Inventory (NEI) for NOx from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is too high. This finding is based on SEAC4RS observations of NOx and its oxidation products, surface network observations of nitrate wet deposition fluxes, and OMI satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 columns. Our results indicate that NEI NOx emissions from mobile and industrial sources must be reduced by 30-60\%, dependent on the assumption of the contribution by soil NOx emissions. Upper tropospheric NO2 from lightning makes a large contribution to satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 that must be accounted for when using these data to estimate surface NOx emissions. We find that only half of isoprene oxidation proceeds by the high-NOx pathway to produce ozone; this fraction is only moderately sensitive to changes in NOx emissions because isoprene and NOx emissions are spatially segregated. GEOS-Chem with reduced NOx emissions provides an unbiased simulation of ozone observations from the aircraft, and reproduces the observed ozone production efficiency in the boundary layer as derived from a regression of ozone and NOx oxidation products. However, the model is still biased high by 8{$\pm$}13 ppb relative to observed surface ozone in the Southeast US. Ozonesondes launched during midday hours show a 7 ppb ozone decrease from 1.5 km to the surface that GEOS-Chem does not capture. This bias may reflect a combination of excessive vertical mixing and net ozone production in the model boundary layer.},

  abstract = {New high quality satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over snow-covered regions of Siberia reveal previously undocumented but significant NO2 emissions associated with the natural gas industry in Western Siberia. Besides gas drilling and natural gas power plants, also gas compressor stations for the transport of natural gas are sources of high amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO\,+\,NO2), which are emitted in otherwise pristine regions. The emissions per station from these remote gas compressor stations are at least an order of magnitude larger than those reported for North American gas compressor stations, possibly related to less stringent environmental regulations in Siberia compared to the United States. This discovery was made possible thanks to a newly developed technique for discriminating snow covered surfaces from clouds, which allows for satellite measurements of tropospheric NO2 columns over large boreal snow-covered areas. While retrievals over snow-covered areas were traditionally filtered out, we used the retrieved column of air in these observations to distinguish clouds higher in the atmosphere from the snow at the surface. This results in 23\% more TROPOMI observations on an annual basis. Furthermore, these observations have a precision four times better than nearly any TROPOMI observation over other areas and surfaces around the world. These new results highlight the potential of TROPOMI on Sentinel 5P as well as future satellite missions for monitoring small-scale emissions and emissions at high latitudes.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) is one of the main data products measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) satellite, which combines a high signal-to-noise ratio with daily global coverage and high spatial resolution. TROPOMI provides a valuable source of information to monitor emissions from local sources such as power plants, industry, cities, traffic and ships, and variability of these sources in time. Validation exercises of NO\textsubscript{2} v1.2\textendash v1.3 data, however, have revealed that TROPOMI's tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) are too low by up to 50 \% over highly polluted areas. These findings are mainly attributed to biases in the cloud pressure retrieval, the surface albedo climatology and the low resolution of the a priori profiles derived from global simulations of the TM5-MP chemistry model.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}This study describes improvements in the TROPOMI NO\textsubscript{2} retrieval leading to version v2.2, operational since 1 July 2021. Compared to v1.x, the main changes are the following. (1) The NO\textsubscript{2}-v2.2 data are based on version-2 level-1b (ir)radiance spectra with improved calibration, which results in a small and fairly homogeneous increase in the NO\textsubscript{2} slant columns of 3 \% to 4 \%, most of which ends up as a small increase in the stratospheric columns. (2) The cloud pressures are derived with a new version of the FRESCO cloud retrieval already introduced in NO\textsubscript{2}-v1.4, which led to a lowering of the cloud pressure, resulting in larger tropospheric NO\textsubscript{2} columns over polluted scenes with a small but non-zero cloud coverage. (3) For cloud-free scenes a surface albedo correction is introduced based on the observed reflectance, which also leads to a general increase in the tropospheric NO\textsubscript{2} columns over polluted scenes of order 15 \%. (4) An outlier removal was implemented in the spectral fit, which increases the number of good-quality retrievals over the South Atlantic Anomaly region and over bright clouds where saturation may occur. (5) Snow/ice information is now obtained from ECMWF weather data, increasing the number of valid retrievals at high latitudes.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}On average the NO\textsubscript{2}-v2.2 data have tropospheric VCDs that are between 10 \% and 40 \% larger than the v1.x data, depending on the level of pollution and season; the largest impact is found at mid and high latitudes in wintertime. This has brought these tropospheric NO\textsubscript{2} closer to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) observations. Ground-based validation shows on average an improvement of the negative bias of the stratospheric (from -6 \% to -3 \%), tropospheric (from -32 \% to -23 \%) and total (from -12 \% to -5 \%) columns. For individual measurement stations, however, the picture is more complex, in particular for the tropospheric and total columns.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {High temperature and pressure during lightning can quickly trigger multiple chemical reactions in the air, resulting in considerable impacts on aerosols, atmospheric chemistry, and air quality. Here, new particle formation (NPF) events motivated by lightning flashes were captured during an observation at Mt. Tai in summer 2017 for the first time. Numerous ultrafine particles were formed during the lightning events, leading to increases in nucleation and Aitken mode aerosols by 18.9 and 5.6 times, respectively. The formation rate (FR) and growth rate (GR) during lightning-generated NPF were 67.1 cm-3{$\cdot$}s-1 and 20.1 nm{$\cdot$}h-1, which were 61 and 1.7 times higher than the averaged daytime NPF. Moreover, chemical composition of aerosols was strongly influenced by lightning NOx. Nitrate aerosol (NO2- and NO3-) signals intensified significantly (by 11.9\% and 12.4\%, respectively) during the lightning-generated NPF, which contrasted with the sulfate aerosols measured in previous studies (non-lightning NPF). Meanwhile, lightning contributed noticeably to surface NO2 concentrations. Accompanying the uplifting airflows before rainfall, surface air pollutants (SO2, NH3, and NOx, etc.) can be transported above the top of the planet boundary layer, which plays an important role in NPF. The NPF in the hot lightning channels resulted from pollution NOx and lightning NOx, with the latter dominating. Finally, lightning-generated pollutants, including NOx and aerosols, were delivered down to the surface with descending airflows.},

MERRA-2 assimilates partial column ozone retrievals from a series of Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (SBUV) instruments on NASA and NOAA spacecraft between January 1980 and September 2004: starting in October 2004, retrieved ozone profiles from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and total column ozone from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's EOS Aura satellite are assimilated. The MERRA-2 ozone is compared with independent satellite and ozonesonde data, focusing on the representation of the spatial and temporal variability of stratospheric and upper-tropospheric ozone and on implications of the change in the observing system from SBUV to EOS Aura. The comparisons show agreement within 10\% (standard deviation of the difference) between MERRA-2 profiles and independent satellite data in most of the stratosphere. The agreement improves after 2004, when EOS Aura data are assimilated. The standard deviation of the differences between the lower-stratospheric and upper-tropospheric MERRA-2 ozone and ozonesondes is 11.2\% and 24.5\%, respectively, with correlations of 0.8 and above, indicative of a realistic representation of the near-tropopause ozone variability in MERRA-2. The agreement improves significantly in the EOS Aura period; however, MERRA-2 is biased low in the upper troposphere with respect to the ozonesondes. Caution is recommended when using MERRA-2 ozone for decadal changes and trend studies.},

In the Tropics, a positive trend is seen in a 5-km layer above the tropopause. Analysis of an idealized tracer in a model simulation constrained by MERRA-2 meteorological fields provides strong evidence that these trends are driven by enhanced isentropic transport between the tropical (20\textdegree S\textendash 20\textdegree N) and extratropical lower stratosphere in the past two decades.

A consistent temporal evolution starting with peak IC activity changing to predominant CG activity and concluding with strong outflow (microburst) suggests that ice is responsible for both the electrical (i.e., lightning) and dynamical (i.e., microburst) phenomena. The IC activity is attributed to the updraft-driven accumulation of graupel particles in the central dipole region, and the subsequent CG activity to the descent of ice particles beneath the height of the main negative charge. The subsequent descent and melting of ice particles beneath the height of the 0\textdegree C isotherm are associated with the acceleration of the downdraft and outflow. The IC lightning precursor can provide a valuable short-term (5\textendash 10 min) warning for microburst hazard at ground level.},

The V2.2 IWC represents a bulk cloud property averaged over a {$\sim$}300 \texttimes{} 7 \texttimes{} 4 km3 volume near the pointing tangent height. Precision, accuracy, and spatial resolution of the V2.2 IWC are determined through model simulations and comparisons with CloudSat observations. Comparisons of MLS V2.2 and CloudSat R03 IWCs are made for the months of January and July in terms of normalized probability density function (PDF). The differences between MLS and CloudSat IWC PDFs are generally less than 50\% over the IWC range where the MLS technique is valid. At pressures {$<$}177 hPa and extratropical latitudes, the MLS V2.2 IWC exhibits a slightly low bias compared to CloudSat, part of which can be attributed to systematic errors in the MLS retrieval.

The results showed the presence of 299 lightning days with 241 688 flashes, most of which were IC lightning flashes. Only 19\% of the total flashes were CG lightning flashes; 14\% of these CG flashes were positive. Most lightning activity occurred during the summer months (June\textendash August), with a major diurnal peak around 1900 Beijing standard time (BST) and a secondary peak around 2300 BST. Spatial variations in flash density and lightning days both exhibited an obvious southeastwardly increasing pattern, with higher flash densities or more lightning days occurring in the southeastern plains and lower values distributed on the northwestern mountains. The {$<$}em{$>$}Z{$<$}/em{$>$} ratio (IC/CG lightning flashes) exhibited a similar spatial pattern, but the percentage of positive CG lightning flashes showed an almost opposite pattern. The results also showed significant topographic effects on the spatiotemporal variations in lightning activity. That is, flash counts on the northeastern and southwestern mountains peaked in the afternoon, whereas those on the southeastern plains peaked in the late night to early morning, which could be attributed to the propagation of thunderstorms from the mountains to the plains.

A commonly used method for converting stroke data into flashes is using the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN) thresholds of maximum temporal separation of 0.5 s and maximum lateral distance of 10 km radius between successive strokes. In the present study, we tested a location-based algorithm with several spatial and temporal ranges, and analyzed stroke data obtained by the Israel Lightning Location System (ILLS) during one year (1.8.2009\textendash 31.7.2010). We computed the multiplicity, the percentage of single stroke flashes and the geographical distribution of average multiplicity values for thunderstorms in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Results show that for the NLDN thresholds, the percentage of single stroke flashes in Israel was 37\% and the average multiplicity was 1.7. We reanalyzed the data with a spatial range that equals twice the ILLS location error and shorter times. For the new thresholds of maximum distance of 2.5 km and maximum allowed temporal separation of 0.2 s we find that the mean multiplicity of negative CGs is lowered to 1.4 and find a percentage of 58\% of single stroke flashes. A unique severe storm from 30 October 2009 is analyzed and compared with the annual average of 2009/2010, showing that large deviations from the mean values can occur in specific events.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The mean total CG and positive CG (PCG) flashes in 2010\textendash 13 are approximately 6.44 million and 0.42 million, respectively, and the mean percentage of PCG (PPCG) is 6.6\%.

FY-4 will also enhance the space weather monitoring and warning with SEP. Current products from FY-2 will be improved by FY-4, and a number of new products will also be introduced. FY-4's sounding and imaging data will be used to improve applications in a wide range of ocean, land, and atmosphere monitoring plus forecasting extreme weather (especially typhoons and thunderstorms); overall, FY-4 will contribute to more accurate understanding and forecasting of China's weather, climate, environment, and natural disasters. This new generation of Chinese geostationary weather satellites is being developed in parallel with the new generation of geostationary meteorological satellite systems from the international community of satellite providers and is intended to be an important contribution to the global observing system.{$<$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

New features of this source relative to the latest published ones by Dignon et al. [1992] and Muller [1992] include synoptic-scale modeling of ``pulsing'' (the emissions burst following the wetting of a dry soil), a biome dependent scheme to estimate canopy recapture of NO{$\chi$}, and an explicit linear dependence of emission on N fertilizer rate for agricultural soils. Our best estimate for annual above-canopy emissions is 5.5 Tg N (NO{$\chi$}) with a range of 3.3\textendash 7.7 Tg N. Globally, the strongest emitters are agriculture, grasslands, and tropical rain forests, accounting for 41\%, 35\%, and 16\% of the annual budget, respectively. ``Pulsing'' contributes 1.3 Tg N annually. In temperate regions, agriculture dominates emission, and in tropical regions, grassland dominates. Canopy recapture is significant, consuming, on average, possibly 50\% of soil emissions. In temperate regions, periodic temperature changes associated with synoptic-scale disturbances can cause emission fluctuations of up to 20 ng N m-2 s-1, indicating a close correlation between emission and warm weather events favorable to O3/smog formation. By the year 2025, increasing use of nitrogen fertilizer may raise total annual emissions to 6.9 Tg N with agriculture accounting for more than 50\% of the global source. Finally, biomass burning may add up to an additional 0.6 Tg N globally by stimulating emissions for a short period after the burn.},

Lightning data have been collected by a lightning detector (Boltek LD-350) and an atmospheric electric field mill (EFM-100) sensors deployed at the Carlini Base on the Antarctic Peninsula (CARL: 62.23oS, 58.63oW). The flash rate and flash multiplicity were analysed for three different seasons within a 1,000\,km range, starting at the end of summer (February 2017) and ending in winter (July 2017). Three storm days for each month (within the 1,000\,km radius from the LD sensor) with three composite active thunderstorms (labelled as Storm region A, B, and C) for each day have been selected from a collection of storm days between February and July 2017. A total of 355,899 flashes have been recorded with 156,190 Positive CG and 199,709 Negative CG flashes from these 54 thunderstorms. In total, Positive CG flash counts made up around 43.9\% of the total detected CG flashes. Most of the Positive CG flashes ({$>$}80\%) had only 1 or 2 strokes with a maximum number of 5. For Negative CG flashes, the average multiplicity and the maximum multiple stroke were 1.2 and 16 respectively. Most CG flashes were detected during the summer and fall months. Positive CG flashes were prevalent in Western Antarctic storms even during the winter. The mean, median and range of the ratio of Positive CG to Negative CG flashes were 0.7, 0.718 and 0.217\textendash 1.279, respectively.},

However, the production efficiency (PE) of lightning nitrogen oxides (LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}}) is still quite uncertain (32\textendash 1100\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO per flash). Satellite measurements are a powerful tool to estimate LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} directly compared to conventional platforms. To apply satellite data in both clean and polluted regions, a new algorithm for calculating LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} has been developed that uses the Berkeley High-Resolution (BEHR) v3.0B NO\textsubscript{2} retrieval algorithm and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem). LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} PE over the continental US is estimated using the NO\textsubscript{2} product of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data and the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) data. Focusing on the summer season during 2014, we find that the lightning NO\textsubscript{2} (LNO\textsubscript{2}) PE is 32{$\pm$}15\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{2} per flash and 6{$\pm$}3\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{2} per stroke while LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} PE is 90{$\pm$}50\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} per flash and 17{$\pm$}10\&thinsp;mol\&thinsp;NO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} per stroke. Results reveal that our method reduces the sensitivity to the background NO\textsubscript{2} and includes much of the below-cloud LNO\textsubscript{2}. As the LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} parameterization varies in studies, the sensitivity of our calculations to the setting of the amount of lightning NO (LNO) is evaluated. Careful consideration of the ratio of LNO\textsubscript{2} to NO\textsubscript{2} is also needed, given its large influence on the estimation of LNO\textsubscript{2} PE.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this study, the ozonesondes and TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) observations for two cases are combined with a model to investigate the effects of typical strong convection on vertical redistribution of air pollutants in Nanjing, southeastern China. The ozonesonde observations show higher O\textsubscript{3} and water vapor mixing ratios in the upper troposphere (UT) after convection, indicating the strong updraft transporting lower-level air masses into the UT and the possible downward O\textsubscript{3}-rich air near the top of UT over the convective period. During the whole convection life cycle, the UT O\textsubscript{3} production is driven by the chemistry (5\textendash 10 times the magnitude of dynamic contribution) and reduced by the LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} (-40 \%). Sensitivity tests demonstrate that neglecting LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} in standard TROPOMI NO\textsubscript{2} products causes overestimated air mass factors over fresh lightning regions and the opposite for outflow and aged lightning areas. Therefore, a new high-resolution retrieval algorithm is applied to estimate the LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} production efficiency. Our work shows the demand for high-resolution modeling and satellite observations on LNO\textsubscript{\emph{x}} emissions of both active and dissipated convection, especially small-scale storms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Data include aerosol optical depth, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning density, convective available potential energy (CAPE), mid-level relative humidity, lower- to mid-tropospheric vertical wind shear, cloud-base height, total column liquid water (TCLW), and total column ice water (TCIW). Results show that CG lightning density and aerosols are positively correlated in the plateau region and negatively correlated in the basin region. Sulfate aerosols are found to be more strongly associated with lightning than total aerosols, so this study focuses on the role of sulfate aerosols in lightning activity. In the plateau region, the lower aerosol concentration stimulates lightning activity through microphysical effects. Increasing the aerosol loading decreases the cloud droplet size, reducing the cloud droplet collision\textendash coalescence efficiency and inhibiting the warm-rain process. More small cloud droplets are transported above the freezing level to participate in the freezing process, forming more ice particles and releasing more latent heat during the freezing process. Thus, an increase in the aerosol loading increases CAPE, TCLW, and TCIW, stimulating CG lightning in the plateau region. In the basin region, by contrast, the higher concentration of aerosols inhibits lightning activity through the radiative effect. An increase in the aerosol loading reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground, thereby lowering the CAPE. The intensity of convection decreases, resulting in less supercooled water being transported to the freezing level and fewer ice particles forming, thereby increasing the total liquid water content. Thus, an increase in the aerosol loading suppresses the intensity of convective activity and CG lightning in the basin region.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Past studies have suggested that ozone in the troposphere has increased globally throughout much of the 20th century due to increases in anthropogenic emissions and transport. We show, by combining satellite measurements with a chemical transport model, that during the last four decades tropospheric ozone does indeed indicate increases that are global in nature, yet still highly regional. Satellite ozone measurements from Nimbus-7 and Earth Probe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) are merged with ozone measurements from the Aura Ozone Monitoring Instrument/Microwave Limb Sounder (OMI/MLS) to determine trends in tropospheric ozone for 1979\textendash 2016. Both TOMS (1979\textendash 2005) and OMI/MLS (2005\textendash 2016) depict large increases in tropospheric ozone from the Near East to India and East Asia and further eastward over the Pacific Ocean. The 38-year merged satellite record shows total net change over this region of about +6 to +7 Dobson units (DU) (i.e., {$\sim$}15\&thinsp;\%\textendash 20\&thinsp;\% of average background ozone), with the largest increase ({$\sim$}4\&thinsp;DU) occurring during the 2005\textendash 2016 Aura period. The Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) chemical transport model with time-varying emissions is used to aid in the interpretation of tropospheric ozone trends for 1980\textendash 2016. The GMI simulation for the combined record also depicts the greatest increases of +6 to +7\&thinsp;DU over India and East Asia, very similar to the satellite measurements. In regions of significant increases in tropospheric column ozone (TCO) the trends are a factor of 2\textendash 2.5 larger for the Aura record when compared to the earlier TOMS record; for India and East Asia the trends in TCO for both GMI and satellite measurements are {$<$}math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" id="M7" display="inline" overflow="scroll" dspmath="mathml"{$><$}mrow{$><$}mo{$>\sim<$}/mo{$><$}mo{$>$}+{$<$}/mo{$><$}mn mathvariant="normal"{$>$}3{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}{$<$}svg:svg xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="26pt" height="10pt" class="svg-formula" dspmath="mathimg" md5hash="48252b8ccd0db32d6368a886837c21fe"{$><$}svg:image xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="acp-19-3257-2019-ie00001.svg" width="26pt" height="10pt" src="acp-19-3257-2019-ie00001.png"/{$><$}/svg:svg{$>$}\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade\textsuperscript{-1} or greater during 2005\textendash 2016 compared to about +1.2 to +1.4\&thinsp;DU\&thinsp;decade\textsuperscript{-1} for 1979\textendash 2005.
